Reg.‚ t. 1846.) Dr. Lindley adds that Elliott consounds this species with
the C. spathuldts of Michaux and Pursh; which, as described by these
authors, he thinks must be s different species, in the way of C. panisdlia,
and allied to the C. virginiana os the English nurseries. We can only ra·
pest the hope we have so olten expressed‚ that, ere long, all the species
of t'rutae‘gus will he brought together in one garder, so as to be studied‚ lpy

well deserves a place in every collection3 and, being of slow growth, it is
particularly eligible for suburban gardens.

is ol' great durability. Du Hamel mentions a plant, living iu his time, in

the Jardin du Val, that was sent to Louis Xl from S ain3 from which
circumstance it was asterwards called, in France, eptae Ergsagne. It was
cultivated in England‚ by Tradescant‚ in 1656; and is recommended by
Parhinson‚ London and wisc, and other old writers on gardening to be
cultivated for its sruit. Notnithstanding this circumstance, old trees are
rarely to be met with in British Gardens; aad the oldest lant that we
