Desaiption, 110. The ligneous species which constitute this order include
the fiuest flowering shrub 10 the world, the rose; and the trees which pro-
duce the most useful and agreeable fruits of temperate elimatos, viz. the
apple, the pear, the plum, the chemy, the apricot, the 000011, and 11101100-
tarine. The 010010 are, 1011110 most part, deciduous low trees or shrubs,
011 producing flowers more or less showy3 and th'e greater number 110110
which are edible. They are chiefly 0011100 01 Europe and Asia3 but
0010101 01 them 010 0100 found in North America, aad some in South
1110011000οἀ the north 01 Africa. The fruit-bearing speeies, and the rose,
hare followed 0100 11001 the earliest period 01 civilisation, and are, perh ,
better known to mankind in general than any other ligneous 010010. llic

teristica of this order, with reference to its cultivation, which are 01 great
importauce to the gardener: the first is, the liability 01 almost 011 the species
to 0 11, aad produce varieties differing, in many cases, more from one
0001 01, than they differ from other species; and the second 10, 11101 they are
remarkably subject to the attacks of rnsccts 0011 diseases. ln point 01 culti-
vation, they almost all require a free soil, not overcharged with moisture, and
rich rather thau 0001; and, while 011 the species are increased by seeds,
which, 1011110 most 0011 010 produced freely in Britain, almost 011 the varieties
are best increased by grafting or budding 3 and not, 00 10 00010 other orders,
with equal ease by cuttings or layers.

Anmrgement ostie Genera. The ligneous genera are included by De
Candolle 10 five tribcs; and the following are their names and distinctions3 the
latter derived mainly from Decandolle’s Prodromur, but partly from Α 00100001
01100πο11011, and Lindlcy’s 1111101110 Not. Syrt. : -
