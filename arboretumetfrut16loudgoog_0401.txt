Bees' de la Motis. Leaves remarkably narrow.

Glcat Morcaau. Branchess reading. Headpyrsmidal. Ahardytree,
and a great bearer. The duit oi most excellent flavour, and hauging

The fl> ' Scotch pearr are recommended hy Mr. Gorrie, as
forms adapted or landscape scenery; but little can be said in favour
oi their fruit, as compared with that os the new Flemish varieties.

The Bmcie, the Golden Knap, aad tte Eloho take fastigiata forms ς the
latter more especially, Mr. Gorrie says, may be called the hom·
hardy poples oi the pear tribe. These trees generally attsin the
height ο from 45st.to host. in as many years, in the Carse of
Gowrie, in Perthshire.

The hmked Lady andthePowMag take spreeding orbiculata forms, such
as will assort with the dces Pseudo-Platanus, and may he called the

thomy hranehes, at first erect, and asterwards curved downwards and pen·
duleus. The roots are sew, and descend perpendicularly‚ with sew laterai
ramifieations, except in shallow aud rich soil. The leaves vary exceedingly
indifferent soils, and in different parts of Europe and Asia: in Britain, they
are generally green, and slightl tomentose, and do not differ greatly in mag·

leaved, the sege-leaved, the elaeagnus-leaved, and other narrow-leeved varieties,
which hy many are considered ιο he species. The fruit of the pear, in a wild
state, is seldom more than a fourth part ol the size of even the most ordin
cultivated varieties; and it is also austere, and uniit to eat. The lant rs
