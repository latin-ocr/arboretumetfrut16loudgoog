Spec. Char, dc. Leaves broadly ovate, rounded at the base, subaugulete, ser·
rated,smooth. Pedunclesin corymbs,glabrous. Flowere odorous, white,
becoming purple before they drop off. The fruit ia flatly orbiculare, os ι
deep green when it selle from the trec, and becoming yellow aster ly’
some tirne on the ground. (Dec. Prod, adopted.) A native of Nort
Americe, from Pennaylvania to Cerolina, and more especially abundant iu
the back parts os Pennsylrania and Virginia. It generally forms a tree
from 1511. ιο 1811111 height, with a trunk 5in. or 6in. in diameter ; but
Michaux hae round it 2511. 1ιὶ h. 11 appears rery doubtful to ιιι, whether
this treeie specifically distinct liora the wildrytpleof the Old World; though
it differs fremit in both the llowere and the ruit having thescent of violata,
the former perluming the air at the blossorning reason. According to
Michaux, some ol the American sarmata malre cider of the fruit ς and itia
also preserved, and made into various aweetrneate. The fruit liea under
the trees all winter, and acldom begine ιο rot till the spring. The leaves,
when young, have a bitter and slightly cromatio taste; whence Michaux
thinks that, with the addition of auger, they would make an agreeahle tea.
This species was introduced into England ιιι 1724, and is not unlr ent
in collectione. ln some places, as at White Knights, and at Pepper ar·
row near Godalming, it hae becorne naturalised in the woods ; and planta
ο1 all ages are found wild, which have sprung up from seeds disseminated by
birds, and which preserve the distinctiva features of the speclea, or rare.
The largest trees at Pepper Harrow are nearly 30ft. in height ς but they
appear to have attained this sire only in consequence of having been drawn
up by other trees. ln British gurdone, the leaves and the fruit are retained
rnuch longer on the tree than is the case with the European crab; so much
eo, that in very nrild seasons, and sheltered situations, it might be almost
considered euhevergreen. The deep green end flat round form ο1 the fruit,
and the lobed and veined character of the leaves, render this sort of Malus
easily distinguished from every other; endthia distiuctiveneeaof character,
