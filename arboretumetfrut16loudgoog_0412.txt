Spes. Clas, 10. Leaves ovate, acute, crenated, wooll on the under surfacc.
Flowersin corymbs. 'l’ube os calyx woolly. Styies glabrous. Wild in
woods and way sides in Europe. (Dec. Prod, ii. p. 635.) cultivated in
gardens, it is wholly, 01 conjorntly with 0111010 00100 01 10000, the parent
01 innumerahle varieties, termed, generally, in 111 land, cultivated epple
trees; and in France, pommiers doux, or pommiersh couteau. We adopt
the specilic name Mhlus, to indicate what may be called the actual form,
101 the 00110 01 convenience, though many of the cultivated varieties are
derived not only from the wild epple, or crab, 01 Europe, but from the
crabs 01 Siberia We shall designate these creba as varieties of P. Malus,
and afterwards male a selection from the cultivated sorta, of such as we
think suitahle 101 being planted for their timber, 01 as omamental trees.
We are awsre that objections may be tehen to this mode, 00 deviating from
the arrangement given by De Candolle‚ who places the P. acerba as
the first, and P. 11110000 the second species of this division; but itis so
utterly impossible to refer the 11101001101101100 correctly to the wild forms
from which they have been obtained, thet we consider the priority of
names as a matter of no 0011 01 consequence. Besides, 00 we have,as
usual, only indicated our own deviatione from established authorities in
parentheses, those who differ from 00 10 opinion will find no difficolt in
recognisi the names and descriptione 01 110 Candolle, and 01 the otders
who have ollowed in his footsteps.

native 01 Siberia3 introduced in 1758. Accordiu to Mr. Knight, some of the
finest varieties raised by him are from cultivated apples fecundated with the
blossoms 01 this trec. The progeny he found formed more hardy trees thau any
other kinds, and that they produced earlier and more highly flavoured 11011.
