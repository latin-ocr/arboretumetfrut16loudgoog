The frults of the trec have been employed by dyers, who derive three oolours
from them, green, yellow, and red. The first is obtained by boiling the secde

capsules. A decoction of the capsules in altariis said to colour hair red;
and the leaves, dried and powdered, and put amo the hair of the heads of
children, is said to drive away vermin: hence one o the names. The fruit is
said to be purgative and emetic in an eminent degree; so much so es not to be
