The species are raised from seeds3 aud the varieties chiefly by grafting
on ffixinus excelsior, but partly also from sceda. Thereis a great
tendency in all the species to sport into varietiec3 and many of what
are by botanists described as species are, in our opinion, not entitled
to thet distinction. ln the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, on the baulra
of the Esk, more especially on the estate of Dalhousie, we are in·
sonned that the ash is indigenous over aeverrd acres ol steep rocky de·
clivities borderin the river, and that many very distinct varietiea may
there be collect . The American ash seems as prolific in varieties aa tha
European species, and some of these varieties, which by bonnists are
treated superisa, generally come true from seed; a circumstance no
more surprisrug than that particular varicties of fruit trees should fre-
quently coms nearly es true to the parent variety, ιι the seedling's of
species come true to species. All the ashes are ol easy culture ht good
soil, and in ι sheltered situation· The general price ol' the American
planta is from lc. 6d. to ιι. sd. per plant ι and seeds may be obtained ol six
or seven ol the sorta at ld. per quart.

are allowed to be venetica by botanists, and are described as such in Don’s

are treated by bobanists as cies, aud which we have accordingly kept
distinct, but which we are ecidedly ol opinion are nothing more than
varietiea.
