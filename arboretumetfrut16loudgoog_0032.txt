Miller, that it prospere on grevel over chnlk ς und Boutcher, that it reiireee
Ι notalmoeten eortof barren ground, hot or oold, and often indicates where

short, the holly is found on cll soils, except ru begu or marcnes. The orest
oi Needwood, which contains eo many fine holliee, ison a free loamy soil, in·

are on gravelly soil, on a substratum os chalk or clay. Thel st holliee in
