in summer, when they are clothed with foliage ς -222
but it differs from them in being evergreen, sud ἃ, , s·
in having the leaves much smaller. Fabricius ²3. J ,ζ’

that the buds in this species are different from ¹ '³' '¹
what they are in the other cortu the branch-
hearing buds being terminal, and tha flower buds
axillary. The leaves have sometimcsbleaflets , , n. v,

winged as to appear like pinnae. The tree isa ⁸ '⁸ ¹³
native of the south of Europe, aud the north of
Africa. lt grows’to the hei bt of 8018, and is cultivated in gardens, as
well as being found in a wile state. Desfontaines, who travelled in Bar·
bary, states that the tree in that country, though punctured as it is in the
leland of Scio, yet does not yield mastich; hut that the wood gives ont an
aromatic smell when burned‚ and the berries yield an oil fit both for the lamp
and for the table. The great source of the mastich of commerce is the island
of Scio, where it is obtained from the trees in the same manner as the
Chian turpentine. The quantity produced there averages, according to Oli·
vier, taaooo lh. annually: but, according to Macculloch, the annual produce is
1500 cwt. The trec was introduced into British gardeur in 16543 but it is
not very common there. It is not so hardy as P. Terebinthus, and should
always be planted against 8 wall.

Description, 118 The species is a deciduous tree, with a large roundish
head,- growing to the height of ldft. in Barbary, near Coffa, not far from
Mount Atlas3 where, from being found in rows, rt appears to have been in 8
state of cultivation. The variety with broad leaves ra found in the island of
Scio,and also about Constantinople. The drupc of this tree isabout the

The Arabs collect it in autumn and winter, and chew it to improve their

bruiae them to mix with their dates. This trec is rately to he met with in
British gardens.
