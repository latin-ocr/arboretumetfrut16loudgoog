Deceptura, dc. The common Judss tree, in the south of Europe, forms a
handsome low tree, with e flat spreeding heed, in the form of e parasol; '
eud it is a singulerly beautiful object in spring, especially when it is covered
with its numerous bright purplish ink nowers, which appear before the leuues,
in May, end are produced not only from the young wood, but from wood of
eote cars’ growth, and even from the trunlr. The leaves are round enrl
heansla ed, auderenotliable to beetteclred by inrecte. The flowers are
succeed by flat, thiu, brown pods, nearlydinchea in length, which remeia on
the trec sll the year, and give it a very singular appearance iu the winter
seaeon. ln meist seesons, the tree osten flevere a second time in the autumn.
ln the neighbourhood of London, the tree ncrally flowers sreely3 but the
pods ere not produced in ebundauce, unless t e tree rs planted agarust a wall;
end only spanngly, and in the finest seesons, on standard trees. The rete of
growth re about le in. ayeer, for the first ten years.
