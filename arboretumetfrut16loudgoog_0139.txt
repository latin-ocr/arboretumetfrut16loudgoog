erer different the results, it msy ssfely be concluded, that souud scacis wood
is heevier, berder, stronger, more rigid, more elsstic, and tougher, then thst
of the best English osk3 end, consequentl ,thet it is nrore lit then oslr for
trensils. The lete Lord King, who h sonte lsrge locust trees ou his
esteteet Ockhsm Court, 'ves the following opinion of the strength sud
durability of the timber. lle says, “ lt endures ss poste longer theu osk or

Goodwood, iu Suseex, there area rest many nescis trees in thgplentstions,
which were plented in the days of llinson and Miller. The timber hes been
chiefl used for out-door fences; sud, ester standing 30 yesrs, is yet perfectl

and durability. (leid, p. 290.) At Cheam, iu Surrey, ou the estete of A.

ss Lord King end Lord Stauhope observe to Mr. ithers (leid, 591. sud

neither calculated to produce straight poles iu the former stote, nor much
timber in the latter. '
ln Americs, according to hfichaux, the greatest consumption of locust
wood is for sts; which, if the tresis felled in winter, when the cir·
culation oft essp is suspended, und the poste ere allowed to becorm
perfecdy dry before they are set, are estimute to lest 40 years. This dura.
tion, however, varies exceedingly, according to the soil sud situation in which
the trees have'grown; those havingl the beart-wood red lasting twice ss long
as those in which rt rs white. Mic eux hes remarked that,1 the truuks ο
the locust trees grown iu the north of Pennsylvsnisexceed 15 in. in disrneter,
when they are cut down end s lit open, they sre frequently found to be de-
csyed st the hesrt; but thet tllis is not the csse with trees that heve grown
fsrther south: which shows thet poor soil and s cold climate ere not suf·
ficientes Governor Pownsll seems to ellege (see p. uls), to melre the tree
produce good timber. The American shipwrights use ss much locust
wood ss they cau procure; finding it es dureble es the live'oek, and
the red cedar; with the advantage of being stronger then the former,
und lighter then the latter. lt is difficult, however, to procure locust
wood of sufficient sire for ship-build' ς for, even in those districts where
the tree thrives best, niue tenths of t e trunls do not euceed lft. in di-
ameter, and horn 30ft. to lost. in height. The wood isuscd sor trenuils iu
‚all the s orte of the middle states, to the exclusion of every other liud of
timber. nstead of deceyiug, it acquires sn extraordinery degree of herdness
with time. ln 1819, these trennils were 10 dollerssthoussnd st Philadelphis3
sud from 50,000 to 100,000 of them were ennuslly exported to Englsnd.
