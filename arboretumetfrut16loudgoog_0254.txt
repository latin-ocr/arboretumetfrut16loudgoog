The number ο1 species ol' Riibus described by Sir J. E. Smitli in the last
edition ol hie English Botcnyi, published in 1824, aa natives of England, are
14: Dr. Hoolier, in his British Flora, published in 1831, enumerates 13 ς
and Dr. Lindley‚ in hia Syriopsisos the British Flora, ad edit, published in
1835, 213 which, he says, maybe reduced tob, or possibly ιο 2, exclusive of
the herbiiceous species. ln our Hortus Britannicus, 68 speeies areenumeiated,
as having been introduced into Britain; and in Don's Miller, itt, as the total
number described by botanists.

Tbe remarks which Dr. Lindley has mede on this subject appear to ns
extremely interesting and valuable, not only with reference ιο the genus
lilibus, but ιο all genera that contain numerous species. Following out the
’ rinciples laid down in the elaborate monogreph of Weihe ¹iirid Nees von

hisenbeclr, Dr. Lindley‚ iii the first edition ο1 his British Flora, advanced tbe
number of British species ιο 233 “certainly,” he observes, “not from any
expectation thatstichs 'es were either genuine, or likely ιο prove a·
nent, but vitii avieir o following out the recognised rinciples os istinc·
tion, and sliowing whither they must inevitably lead.’' lhtbe second editiori,
he observes: “This proceeding has not found favour in the eyes os those
from whom 1 most expected applauec e.. . .it has had one good effect how·
everr . . ..it has led me tocoaaider the subject very earesully, and ιο examine
with more attention the nature ο1 the principles upon which the modern and

other conclusion than that with which 1 first started; namely, that we have
ιο chooae between considering 11. ecberectus, ll. frutitdsus, 11. corylitTilius,
and R. celsius, the only uine speciem or adopting‚ in a great measure, the
characters of the leam German botanists, Weihe and Nees von Esenbech,
who have so much dannguished themselves in the elaboration ο1 the genua
So clear is my opinion upon thia point, that, if it had been ossible to prove
the soiir species to which 1 have alluded to be themselves pllysiologically dis·
nnct, 1 should at once have reduced all the othere ιο their original speciem
but, asitis in the highest degree uncertain whether 11. fruticdrus, 11. coryli·
l'dlius, and it. crelsius are not as much varieties of each other as those which
it would be necessary ιο reject, 1 liare thought it better ιο steer a middle
course, until some procsshall have been obtained either one way ortbe other.
Accordingly, as will be seen by what follows, 1 have taken R. fruticosus, R.

itfor the presenr.” (bird. Syricp. Brit. Ft, ed edition, p. 92.) lt appears ιο
us highly probable, that the four forms mentioned above are only veneries ο1
the same species3 and this would reduce the ligneous British nibusea to the
raspberry and the hramble. The species exclusively North American, as far
ss we haveobserved them in the gurden ο1 the Horticultural Society, include
four with the habit of raspberr ,and three with the habit ol the bremble3
but the latter three, 11. flagellaris, R. inermis, and it. setosus, are robably·
only varieties ol the same species. The Nepai rubuees‚ as lar se ey have
been hitherto introduced, are all brambles; but there is one, 11. concolor,
which, hir. Royle observes, ii found on lohy mountains, and comes near to
the raspberry. ir. micrdnthus is, erhaps, the only distinct species ol llepal
bramble that lias been introducetlh some plenta, raised from Nepal seeds,
which may be observed in the Chelsea Botanic (iarden, and in the garden ο1
the Horticultural Society, being evidently nothing more than vmieties ο1 tbe
British bremble. The course which we have adopted with respect to the
ligneoiis species ο1 this genus is, ιο give, first, a descriptive enumeration olsll
the ligneoua species or veneries, indigenoun or introduced, elaborated honi
