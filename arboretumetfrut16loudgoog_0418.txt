Neither the apples, nor the pulp‚ are exposed to the open air; and, if euy rain
falls on the fruit while its being gothered,¹ it is considered unfit for use. The

Another point of difference is, a clause generally inserted in the leeses in Derou-

In Ssotlosd, crder has not hitherto been mede; but, as the climate, 'elly
in all the low lsnds of the country, is drier and warmer than that of land,
end is consequently better adopted for n'pening fruit, if epple trees were intro-
duced into the bedgerows, in some plaoes; au , where tlus could not be done,
if lorge orchards were planted edjoioing the farm-houses, cider might be as

ln Nonuondy, cider was made before it was io Englandr and the art of
making it is said to have been brought into that country from Spain; where,
however, it is no longer practised. The Norman mode of making cider closely
resembles that generally prsetiaed in Devonshire. The lformsus gether their

In Ammioo, cider is almost anniversa] bev in Now England, and in

trees are chalcen, greet care is tehen to cover the ground with ooarse cloths
or Ruscino mats, to prevent the apples from being bruised. When gamuel,
the apples are laid in heaps in a room, and kept osrefully from the rain or
dew. lo grinding, care is tnlren to reduce “ the whole fruit, elin sud seeds, to

fine pulp‚ and to perform the operation in cool westher. The late Joseph
Cooper of New J ersey hes observed emphatically, that ‘the longer a choese
[that is, the mass of epple pulp] lies after being ground, before preesing, the
better for the cider, provided it escapes fermentation until the pressrogit
completed.’' (Kenrr'clr’r American Orolardirt, p. 121. ln some esses, the
pomace, or mese of pulp‚ is suffered to remain a w or ten days efter itia
ground, before it is submitted to the prees (provided the westher be not too
warm), stirring the mess every day. (lbr‘d.)
