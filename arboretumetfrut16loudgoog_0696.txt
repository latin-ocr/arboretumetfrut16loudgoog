indeed, may be removed when they ere in full flower. The beat amaon for

The soil of the beda ought to be wholly renewed every five or aix yearsg
and, when thiais done, all the planta ought to be taken up aad divided, pruued,
or thrown away, end replaced with other planta, aa may be found necessary.
The soil removed may be laid in ridges, in the reserve den, and mixed with
an equal quantity, or more, of leel mould3 and. alter ying ayear or two, it
may again be put to use in the erieacetum. The cultivator of Ericdceae, of
rosea, and ol other shrubs that ere rvn chiefly for their llowers, should
beer constantly in mind, that these ni l not be produced in abundence, aud of
fine forms and colours, unless the plant have am le notuishment, light, and
air. Instead, therefore, of rhododendrons stulp aaaleas being planted iu
poor heath soil, and being crowded together so as ιο show only the upper
surface of the plants, aa they now are in most gardent, they ought to be
planted in sandy peat snd loam, enricbed with a large proportiou of leaf
mould; and each shrub ought to stand perfectly detached; and it should
rather be as much as 2li. from the adJ'oimng one, than so near it aa ain, iu
order that the roots may have sufficient space on every side to enable them to
collect nourishment, end that the heads of the planta may not shade one
another. The only two ericacetums that we recollect aeeing managed to
our satisfaction in these particulare are, that of the Rev. Thomas narnia, at
Bishopstolte Vicarage; and that at Bagshot Parlr, under the care of blr.
Tovvard. At the former place the Ericlceae are planted in roundish groupa
ou the lawn adjoining the house ; and they grow so vigorously that they are
taken up and re lanted every two years, generally in the mouth of September.
