Cuitare. The rose, in an artificial state, may be considered in the light of
ao herbaceous plant3 in so far that it requires to be frequently taken up and
replanted, that this may be done at almost any season, and, also, that it should
have its old wood cut out every year, or every second or third year.

Plaalirrg rosea should, in general, be performed in the autumn; bnt, with the
more delicate varieties of China rosas, and with R. multifora, R. moechata,
and their varieties, it may be deferred till spring. As roses have but few
fibrous roots, the operation of planting them may be easily and rapidly per·
formed; the chief point being to put some fresh soil in the hole along with the
roots, and to press the earth firmly to them. In cold clayey soils, Mt. Rirers
recommends, es the best compost for rosea, rotten dung andpit saad; and in
warm dry soils, rotten dung andcool luania. When stendar rosas are to he
planted ina broad border, it is almost nunecessary to observe, that those
nearest the walk should be the lowest, and those at the greatest distance from
it the highest. Α horder 15 ft. or 20 ft. wide, planted in this nimum, with
five or six parallel rows, quincunx in the plan, and rising one abore another
iu the elevation‚ has a very splendid effect when the plants are in flower.

Taling ap aad Rrpkmtiag. 'l'he rose, whether grown as a standard or a
dwarf, oug t to bc taken up every five or six years, even in good soils, aad
have its roots shortened and trimmed; a portion of the soil in which it grew
should also be removed, and replaced by rich fresh loam. lu unfaronrable
soils, Mr. Rivers remarks, this process ought to be performed every third or
fourth year. Dr. Van Mons says that the practice in Belgium, even in the
best soils, is to take up tbe plants at the end of eight years, and either replace
diem in fresh soil, or throw thern away, and substitute young planta. In com-
mon flower-borders, where dwarf roscs are not grafted, aad where, of course,
they produce suckers freely, they should be taken up every other year, aad
replanted; the digging and manuring of the horder occasioning a change in the
position of the soil relatively to that of the plant, and thus producing nearly
the seme effect as the partial renewal of the soil.

Planting to retord tlte Flowering ο] Rosea. 'l'he rose may be taken up and
replanted at any seaaon, provided the shootsare shortened, and d rivcd of all
their leaves; and the soil in which they are planted liberally suppli with water.
Hence roses, taken up just before they are coming into flower, and properly
pruned and replanted, will produce their flowers in November; or, by planting
tbem in pots, and placing them in a shady situation, and then putting them
under glass on the first appearance of frost, they may be rnade to produce
their flowers about Christmas. Practices of this kind were formerly common
among the florists of Paris, but ltave been, in a great measure, relinquished
since the introduction of the ancer-scented Cbina roses3 which, placed in a
moderate beat, under gissa, in autumn, continue llowering all the winter.
Rosea may also be made to flower in the'aututnn by pruning themlback. in the

flowera, which effertis not attended witin success till late in the season.

The Roas des Quane Scirem is a good sort for employing in these operations3
and Durnont observes that this rose, when pruned immediately aller it bas
bloomed for the first time, arsy be made to produce its flowers during wintery
being, of course, protectcd by a hand-glasa, and covered with mats during
very severe westher. ln all experimenta for forcing rosea in the open air, rt
must be reinarketl‚ that it is essential for the soil to be fresh and rich, and
