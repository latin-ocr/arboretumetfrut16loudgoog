The hundred-leaved rose is the variety most commonly grown, both in Franco
and England, for its petala. The rose de Provins, however, is cultivated on s
large scale iu the vicinity of Paris, on account, according to Base, of its
tonic and astringent properties, which are diametrioslly opposite to those of
most other roses, which are all more or less laxative or purgative. According
tu an analysis of the petsls of the rose de Provins (R. gallica), as grown iu the
extensive plantatione of Fontenay aux Rosea, they are found to contsin a cer-
tain gallic acid and tanniu, which accounts for their medical properties. The

that slowly dried petala do not exhale nearly so much odour ss those which

odoriferous vegetables generally. After the petala are drred, they are freed
from any send, duat, or egga of insecta, which may adhere to them, b shalring
them, and rubbing them entlyin aline sieve. After this,the petella are put

apothecary of Provins, who has written a dissertation upon the roses iu the
