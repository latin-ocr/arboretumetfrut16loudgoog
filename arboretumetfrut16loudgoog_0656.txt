April, 1835, was 2ft. high, and alt. in diameter, nith the extre-
mrties of its line leufy branches terminated yrith clusters of large,
beautiful, straw-coloured flowers. The climate of Scotland seems
to suit this, and some of the other species found in the coldest parts
of the Ruasian empire, better than that of the south of England.
