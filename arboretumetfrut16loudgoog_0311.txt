When verduni Sculpture or Architecture is to he employed in gardana, there
are very few planta that will so soon cover frume work as the evergreen
climbing roses; and they have the advantage over ivy of producing fine
howms, which are succecded by fruita that attract singrng brrds; aud over
other hepid-growing climbers, such as the Ampeldpsis hederhcea, in addition
to these advantages, tbut of being green all the year.

Poetical, mythologital, historiast, and legeudmy Allariour. The roae has
bosna favourite subject with the poets of all coenulas, in all ages; and s
tolerably large volume might he formed, if all the poema written on it were
collected, as there has, perhaps, never yet existed a poet of any emiuence,
who has not sung its praises. In mythological allusione it is equally rich.
lt was dedicated hythe Greeks to Aurora, as an emblem of youth, from its
freshness and reviving fragrante ; to Venus, as an emblem of love and beanty,
from the elegance of its flowers3 and to Cupid, as an emblem of fugacity and
danger, from fhe fleeting nature of its chartus, and the wounds inflicted by its
thorus. lt was given by Cupid to Harpocrates, thegod of silence, as a bribe,

ueste, that what was said in momenta of conviviality should not be repeated,
horn which what was intended to be kept secret n’as said to be told ‘¹ under
tbe rose,” The Greek poeta say that the rose was originally white, but that
it was changed to red, according to some, from the blood of Venus, who
lacerated hcr feet with its thorus when rushing to the aid of Adonis; and,
according to others, from the blood of Adonis himself. The fragrante of
the rose rs said by the poeta to be derived from a cup of nectar thrown over
it by Cupidr and its thorus to be the atinga of the bees with which the arc
of his bow was strun . Anacreon makes the birth of the rose coeval with
those of Venus aud hlinerva :-

The carth produced an infant flower,

Which sprung with bluahing tincturas drot,

And nu the Rosa-the boon ot earth.'' Mooaa's Amnon.

Another fable relating to the birth of the rose is, that Flora, having found
the dead body of one of her favourite nympha, whose beanty could only be
equalled hy her virtue, implored the assistance of all the gods aad goddesses
to aid ber in changing it into a flower which all others should acknowledge
to bs their queen. Apollo lent the vivilying power of his beams, Bacchus
hathed itin nectar, Vertumnus gave its perfumc‚ Pomona its fruit, and Flora
herself its diadem of flowers. Other mythologice} writers relate that the
beautiful Rhodante, Queeu of Corinth, to escape the persecutione of her
lovers, attempted to seclude herself in the temple of Dianur but, being forced
by the clamour of the people from her sanctuary, prayed to thegods to change
her into a rose; which still bears the blushes that dyed her cheekt when
forced to expose herself to public gaze, and under which form she is still
uuiversslly admired. Α beetlc is osten. represented, on antique gems,as

roses, that the smell of them will cause its death.

The Ronmur were very fond of rosea. Pliny tells us that they garnished
their disbes with these flowers ; and we have already alluded (p. 785.) to their
cnstom of wearing garlanda of them at their feasts. Cleopatra received Antony,
at one of her banquets,in an apartmeut covered with rose leaves to a consider·
able depth; and Antony himself, when dying, begged to have rosas scattered
on his romb. 'l'he Roman generals, who bad achieved any remarkable vic·
tory, were permitted to have rosea sculptured on their shields. Roas-water

was the favotuite perhrme of the lloman [adim and the most luxurious even
uspdit in their baths.
