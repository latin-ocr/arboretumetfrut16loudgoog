with that of all the Rosaceae, isliable to have its natural colour changed by
steeping it in water; which ought, therefore, tobc avoided when it is intended
for particular purposes. It is readily stained black, and then so closely resem-
bles ebony as to be scarcely distinguishable from it. According to Du Hamel,
itis, nent to the true servioe (P. Sdrbus domestica), the best wood that can
be employed by wood engravers ς which use Gernrd also seems to hint at when
he says rt “likewise serveth to be cut into many kindes of moulds ; not only
auch prints as these figures are made of, but also many sorta of pretty teies,

The great use of the pesr trec, however, is as a fruit trec. The fruit is used
in the dessert, and for stewing end preserving. lt is also occasionally used in
tarta, though very inferior for this purpose to apples. In France and Belgium,
the fruit is very generally dried in ovens, in which state it forms an article of
commerce both domestic and foreign, and will keep a year. Itis also dried in
this manner in Russia; and, when stewed, is excellent, either as asubstitute for
pienum puddings, or aa forming part os the dessert. Pears are dried in

rauce in two ways: one, for family use, by putting them, without their being
pared, into an oven, aster the bread is drawn, either on the bricks, or on
raised frames ο1 tin or boards. The pears are put in two, three, and some-
times eren four times, according to their siae, and to the degree of heat that
there is in the oven. The only things that it is necessary to attend to are, to
take care that the oven is not so hot as to burn the pears, and that they are
not lest in so long aa to make them hard. Melting sugary pears, of the*
