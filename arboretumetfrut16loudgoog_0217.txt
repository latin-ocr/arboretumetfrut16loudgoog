every bod, and especially with children. The hard-fleshed kindsarecon·
side-ed rader indigestible when eaten in large quantities; but the solt-fleshed
sorta, such as the morellos, are esteemed so wholesome as to be given in fevers,
where there is stendency to putridlty. ln France, the fruit, more espe-
cially of the softfleshed kinds, is dried by exposing it on bonrds to the sun,
crin an oven moderatelyheated. lt is also preserved in the same manner
in Germsny end in Russia. Ripe cherries are used for making cherry
bandy, and precer-ves, marmnlades, lorenges, and various other kinds ol con·
fernonery, are manufactured from them. An oil is drawn from the kernels,

Kasmwasser. The method of making this celebrated spirit is, to take bruised
chemies, in which the greatest pert of the kernels have also been broken, and
ιο let them remain in a mass till the vinens fermentation is fairly establishedy
alter which the process of distillation is commenced, and continued as lon
as the liquorcomes over clear; or till about apint of liquor has been obtain
from every 20 pinta of fermented pulp. The kirschwasser comes from the
still as clear as the purast water ς and, in order that it may not receive
any tinge which would lesaen its velue, it is always kept in stone vessels or
bottles. More detailed methods of making it will bc found in the Gar-
deaer’s Magnae, voliv. . 179.; and in the same work, vol. viii. p. 182. The
best kirschwasser is mad in Alsace in France, in Wirtemberg 1n Germany,
snd et Beme and Basle in Switzerland. An cherry will produce it, but,
asbefore obscrred, the wild hlack gean is gres ypreferred. .

Marasclrino is also made from the cherry, much in the same manner as
kirschwasser. The kind of cherry preferred lor this p ose isa small
aeid fruit, called maresca, which abounds in the north ofmllaly, at Trieste,
and in Dalmatia. That of Zara, in Dalmatia, is considered the best. All the
fnrit employed in making the Dalmatian mareschino is cultivated within 20
miles of this city, at the font of the mountain Clyssa, between Spalatro and
Almissa, on the side of a hill lanted with vines. The chief difference be-
tween the reparstion of this iqueur and kirachwasser consiste in mixing
the mass ofbmnm cherries with honey; and honey or line sugar is added to
the spirit aller it is distilled. The genuine mareschino ir as difficult to be
met with as genuine Tokay; the greater part of that which is sold as such,
being nothing more than kirschwasser mixed with water and'honey, or water
md angar. The mmasca cherry hes been cultivated in Franco with aview
ιο the manufactum of thia liqneur in that country; and it has been said that
it may be mede just ss good from the common wild black cherry. It is also
said, that, in Dalmatia, the leaves of the tree are made use of in order to give
the peculiar aroma which is ao much esteemed in the mareschin03 and that
this perfume may be inoreased ιο any extent desired,b mining the leaves of

' Medicinally‚ the fruit of the cherry, more especially of the soh-fleshed
