llsta, thr-ive wrth great luxuriance on the margins of streams, in alluvial and
vegetable soils; but rnany species of the same, and of other genera, vary
hom the merel rules, and are found, either iu pure saud, orru stiff clay,
exposed, ough great part of the ear, to excessive hest and drought, or but
slightly sheltered and nurtured by tlte mountains ς but deriving much of their
subsistente from the dewy clouds which those he' hts, as the clouds pmsovar
them,arrcst and condense. So readily do Sout African lanta appear to
accommodate themselves to soils aud situations, that it is difficolt positively
to recommend any particular com st for them in gardan culture. Praetical
experience must alone decide the est for the purpose.

Mt. Bowie recommends the forming of portahle houses for the receptiou of ,

Leguminiceae, which would amply repay the amateur for the trouble and ex·

liam by the splendour which planta having a sufficiency of room would exhibit.

therefore advises planting in heds of prepared soil, formed in auch

structores as fancy might determine, or circumstances permit, messes of Cape

and Australian minitere, arranging them so that every plant might receive

' n ο the sun’s ruys through the a ς placing the taller iu the

gradually diminishing the lines to the , where the minor kinds

phould form the berder, and would not exceed the lreeight of many species of
emosses.

lf young planta (say of 3 years old) are intended for the above description
of houaes, they should be brou ht as carl as possible to a fit state, bygi '
them larger pots than they wo dhave owed to them,were they intend
for the stage or shelf of a green-house. As young planta will be small, in
proportiou to the space they are hereaher to fill, several of the species may
be pluu over the rim of the pots, and marked for future removal. This
will, wi out derangin the plan, allow sufficient roem for those which remaint
those to he removed, liaving shall of eamh attached to them, will be fit spe·
cml-'edatlfistrdlltl ilihih’epdlpeffair, Mr. Bowie recommends a northern exposure
for planung, rather than asouthem oue; as ru the latter situation,alter severe
frosts, a sudden thaw does most mischief, and, in many instantes, is the real
cause of death to the plants. If large plants, thus exposed, appear killed by
cold, too much haste must not be exercised in removing the roots ς but the
planta must be cut down; and the stem and the stool left in the round for one
or two years. When old lants are intendedfor the portable house, or fora
conservatory, they should he headed down toa convenient height, allowing
sufficient room for their heads to form free of the roof; and, aa the various
species of Schdtia flower occasionally ou the old wood, and the others at the
extremities of the young spring and summer sitente, these habits should be
strictly attended to, and borne tn mind, at all seasous.

Many personaregret the loss of old established plants3and,inthevainattempt
to preserve them in aconfined space, permit injuriea to be inflicted upon theru,
by injurious pruning, which eventually render themunsightly aud disagreeahle
