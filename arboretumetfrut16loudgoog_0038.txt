several other rdens in the neighbourhood of
London, till esevere winter of 1789, when .
most of the planta ol it were destroyed. Other planta were afterwards
raised from seed, and they have ever since resisted the cold os ordin
wintere without covering. ln the first edition of Du Hanoel, it is state
that this species had been a long time cultivated by the Chevalier Jansen,
in bis gardan at the Barribre Chaillot at Paris. Rufinesque states that the
true caesena is rechoned a hol plant by many ol the southern tribes of
American Indians, being used, during their religione rites and solemn

coancila, to clear the stomach and the head. Women are forbidden

to use it. For these purpoaea the leaves and young shoots are collected

with care, and, when ried, form sn article of trade among the tribes. They
often perch or scorch slightly the leaves before using them. The' are
inodorous, the tante is sub-aromatic and servid, and they are u ul in

having no od water to drinh, purify it, by boiling it with a little caesena

for the cassena; and many other abraba appear to be used indiscriminntely
for making the blech drink: sor example, the Cassiae ramuldsa ol the Flora

Carolins and Florida, by the native lndians, has given riae to theo inion
that this species was the Paragusy tea mentioned in Martyn’s Mula on
