Greeks to the peach,⁸ which is indigenous in 11101110. 11100 001 only mentions

before that time. The golden pippin is said to 1010 11000 originated at Par-

the 0111011100, aad some other kinds, amounting in all to seven ; but, he says,
there ate agraet many others; adding, that Kent “ doth abound with apples
of most sorts” He afterwards mentions that he has “seen in the pasturas

seems to have been constantis increasing to the present time. A great many

been collected in the gardan 01 the London Horticultural Society, where there
are now (1836) upwards 01 1400 distinct sorts, exclusive 01 synonyma, to
which number additional sorta are being added every year; and their compa-

ing to the locality in which it is grown. In a green state, it weighs frona
48111. 10 66111. 001 cubic foot; and it loses from an eighth to a tweltth of
110 bulk 10 drying, 0011 about atenth of its weight. Tbe wood of the cultivated

apple tree wood was formerly a good deal used in turnery, and 00 cogs for
sabaeis, for which latter purpose it was found very durable. The tree, as an
object in landscape scenery, cannot be recommended as harrnonising well with
other forms; but, 0011 has 0 character of its own, and 110 1110 1101110 01 1110
