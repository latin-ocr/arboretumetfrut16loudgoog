liquor, like a scum, will appear on the surface: this must be removed, and the
liquor strained‚bcfore it is mixed with apples,as before. This scum is thetartarie
acad, which would spoil the raisine, and prevent it from lreeping, but which is not

marmalade is compoaed of cider and pearsy but it‘is not so good asythe other
kind, being apt to ferment. ln some cases, the pears are put into an earthen
ressel without water, and placed in a balrer’s oven aller the bread hasbeen
drawn, previously to mining with the cider. The best misine is considered very
wholesome, particularly for children, who eat it spread on bread, and for per·
sons in delicate health, whose stomacho will not bear butter, and is in Franco
what marmalade is in Britain, and more especially in Scotland. Raisine is
abundant and cheap in Paris3 where, however, a composition isollen sub·
stituted for it, made of honey and water, instead of wine; an imposition
which may be detected by putting the raisine in water, with which it will not
unite if pure. In Italy, the raisine is eatan with preparatione either of Indian
corn, or of macoaroni, to givea flavour to these dishes. (Nesaeos Cossa

Poeticcl aad legendnry :illenim The apple tree was formerly supposed to
be the tree of knowledge, the fruit of which was eaten by Eva in Paradises
and it is a curicus fact, that the a ple tree is also distinguished by legenda
in the mytholo 'es of the Groelss, tlle Scandinavians, and the Druids. The
pagana bellov that the golden fruit of tha Hesperides, which it wasone of the

’ aboura of Hercules to procare, in spite ofthe fieroe dragon that guarded them

aad never slept, were ap les; though modern writers have supposed them
oranges. (See Encyc. of dara, edit. 1835, p. 4. and p. 5.) ln the Edda, we
are told that the goddess lduna had the cara of apples which had the power
of conferring immortality3 and which were, consequently, reserred for the
gods, who ate of them when they began to feel themselves growing old. The
evil spirit Lolse toolr away lduna and her apple tree, and hid thern in a forest,
where they could not be found h the gods. ln consequence of this malicious
thefi, every thing went wrong in tieworld. The gods became old and infirm3
aud, enfeebled both in body and mind, no longer paid the sarm attention to
the affairs of the earth; and men, having no one to lools alter them, fell into
evil courses, and became the prey of the evil spirit. At length, the gods
finding matters get worse and worse every day, roused their last remeius of
vigens, and, combining together, forced Loke to restore the tree The dmids
paid particular reverence to the apple trec, because the mistletoe was supposed
to grow only on it and tlte oalr; and also on account of the great usefulness
of the fruit. ln consequence of this feeling, tha npple was cultivated in
Britain from the earliest ages of which we heve any record; and Glastonbury
was called the apple orchard, from the great quantity ol apples grown there
previousl to the arrival of tha Romans. (See p. 22.)
