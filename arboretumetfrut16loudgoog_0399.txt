Deroprtion. Low trees, end some shrnbs; almost all deciduousr serires
os Europe, Asia, and North America. Some ol them in great estimation
throughout the world for their frain and others cultivated chiefly for their
flowers. Under the enus Pyrus, botanists have lstcly united the Linnaean

down by botanistsa but we cannot help stating our opinion, that it would be
much more convenient, in aprectr'csl point ol view, in establishing genera, to
calte Into consideration the eoves, the character oi the vegetation, the phy·
siology, end even the habit, ol the plant, thau merely to draw the detincuve
character-latice from the parts ol fructificatior. ln consequence ol attending
Ι only to these parts of plante, the genus Pyros, es at present constituted, con-
tains species, such ss the epple and pest, which will not graii on each other3
a circumstance which clear y shows t at the unron oi these two lrrndsol plante
in one genus is not s natural one. We not only think that no plante should
be eomprehended in the same genus which rrill not grah recl rocelly ou esch
other, but thet plante ol differem hchits or constitutions sh d not he united3
nd, consequently, thet twining plante should not be united with troes and
upright shruhs ς nor deciduous trees sud shrnbs with ererpreens. In short,
as we heve stated ic p. sis, we would l'orm genera on a Irind ol na
turcl system, from all the circumstances ot* the plaut taken together,
end not from any articulsr part, or circumstance, or cless ol circumstances,
belonging to it. ethinlr we may refer, in conllrmstion ol the pro riety os
this doctrine, to the excellent observatione that have been qimted riom Dr.
musy, under the heed oi deec3 not without a hope, es it was in the
