in British gardens3 and, judging l'rom the trees in the garden of the London
Horticultural Society, end in the arboretum of Messrs. Loddiges, we should
conjecture that there is, robahly, not more than two species, the American,
and the chinese; possibiy only one. The Chinese speeies is distinguished
hy its trunk being more spiny than ite branchee.
