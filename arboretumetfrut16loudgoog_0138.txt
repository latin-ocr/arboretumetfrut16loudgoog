in height the birch, the perfumed cherry, the chestnut, the yew‚ and the com-

in a single row, exposed to the air on every side, succeed much better;

beoeuse rt ts found from experience that they require a great deal ο1 1’ ι and
air sor their leaves and branches, and a great deal of suriace soil or their
widely s reading creeping roots. M. Mallet had no better success in the

only in a sarourable climate, and in a ood soil, that the tree attains a great
site, even in its native country. ln rance, and particulari in the neigh-
bourhood of Paris, the trec is seldom seen os a ter height than 501ι. οι
60st. ln Germany, the tree thrives in the mid( le states, attaining a conai-
derable height even at Berlin and Munich. ln Sweden and Denmark, in
favourable situations, it seems to grow nearly as high as it does in France.
ln Anaetica, the locust has been planted here and there about farm-houses.
and along seneen and, since the foresta were in a great measure destroyed in
the war ο1 independence, many ersons have cultivated the tree for its tim-
ber, and have supplied trenails, iloni the larger trees, to the shipwrights of
New Yorlt. These plantatione seldom excced the extent of 20 or 30 acres in
one place, though several agricultural societies have offered premiums for their
encoupagement. b'I‘houghkt‘lpcblocusttree, in its ”atumhhssitffsshhffi ιιοὲὴοι·

attackcd by a winged insect, which deposited its egga in the bark; and the
caterpillars produced from them penetrated into the centre ο1 the trunk of the
trec, mining it in every direction, so that the trunk became completely perlo-
rand, and was easily broken over by the wind. ln consequence of the discou-
ragement given bythis circumstance to planting the locust in America, and the
coustant consumption in that country osche timber afforded hythe indigeuous
trees, Michaux thinks that tha time may come when the locust trec will be
more abundem in Europe than in America. This insect is probably the
Cdsaus roblniae of Peck. (See Ktrby arrd Spence’t Introduction to Entontology‚
vol. iii. p. 223.) lt does not appear, that, in America,s rich soil injures the
trae, as ssbeen alleged by (lov. Pownall (see .615.); lorMichaux says that,
where it attains the lar est sine,and roduces the best timber, in Kentucky and
West Tennessee, the land, when clearedwill yield from ³0 to 60 bushels of
macae an acre, ior several years m succession, without manure. ln America,
