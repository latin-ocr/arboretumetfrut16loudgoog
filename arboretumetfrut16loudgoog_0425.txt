about the middle of thglmoufgwhich time the apples are well set. ryThe moth
now lays its egga in the eye of the ap le, one only in each, by introducing
its long ovipositor between the leaves oi the calyx, which form arent above
it, that effectually ahields it from the inclemency of the westher, or any other
easualty. “ As soon aa the egg harches, the httle grub gnaws a hole in the
crown of the apple,and soon buries itself in its substance3 and it is worthyof
remark, that the rind of the ple, as if to afford every facility to the destroyer,
isthinner here than in an ohher part, and, consequently, more easily pierced.

it must be so constructed as to allow the power of gravity to assistin heeping
it clear. It is accordingly made directly downwsrds, towards that pert of
the ap le which is lowest; and thus the trouble of thmsting the pellets
upwndi through the eye of the apple is saved, and aconstent admission

however, sufficiently open for an observer to gain by its means any know·
ledge of what is going on within ς this is only to be obtained by cutting open

a number of the apples, as they predually advauce towards ripeness ; the bole

is, however, very easily seen, rom its always having adhering ιο it, on the
outside, sn accumulation of the little grains which heve bean thrust through.
Having completed this worlr, the grub returns towards the centre of the epple,
where he faeda at his esee. When within a few da ‘s of being full fed, he,
for the first time, enters the core, throu h a round hoie gnawed in the hard
homy substance which always separatestie pipsufrom the pulp of the fruitt
and the destro er now finds himself ιιι that spactous chambe, which sodlins,
in particular, ways have in their centre. From this time he eats only the
the ips, never again tasting the more common pulp, which hitherto had
satisied his unsophisticated palnte; now nothing less than the highly iln-
{enred apomatic kernels will suit his tooth; and on these, for a few days, he

the heart of an animal with its life: injure the beart, an animal dies ς injure
the pips, an apple falls. Whether the sall of his house gives the tenant naming

leaves thecum, crawls along his brenthing snd clearingeut gullery, themouth
of which, before nearly closed, he now gnnws intoe smootb round bole, which
will it him free passage, without herting his fat, soii, round body; then

He now wanders about on the ground till he finds the stem of a treet up this
he climbs, and hides himself in some nice little craclr m the barli. 1 s oultl
remmlt thet the sall of the epple, the exit os the grub, aud his wandering to
this place of security, usually take place in the night-time. In this situation
he remains without stirring for a day or two, as if to rest himself after the
uncommon fatigue of atwo yards’ march; he then gnaws away the berh a
little, in order to et further ιο out of the way of observatione and, having
