branched; those on the stem grouped and branched. The leaflets ovate·

the American species. The ines, which are very strong and branchy, are
more abundant on the trun than on the branches, and are frequently
found in bundles. The leaves are bipinnate‚ and the leallets are elli tic
obtuse, notched on the edgen, smooth, shining, aud much larger than
those of any other species. (Desf. Arb.,ii. p. 248.) The pods are rarely
above din. long. The trec stands the cold better than the honey locust,
and has ri nedits fruit in Paris, in the Jardin des Plantas, and in the
nurseryof Cels. (Dict. des Eume des Fore‘ts, vol. ii. ‚150.) Thenete
of growth, judging from young trees in the garden ol ti London Horti·
cultural Society, and in the arboretum of the Measra. Loddiges, is nearly
the same as that of G. trissanthos. A full-grown tree of thrs specics in

Other Varieties osG. amsa. In Loddiges's arboretam there is a plant
marked G. chiensis (Potts), which was imported from China by the London
Horticultnral Socicty. Itis, at present, a low bush, and may, perhaps,
prove something distinct. There were also, in 183⁵, in the Horncularral
Society’s Garden, some plants without names, apparently belonging to this
species ς bnt, as we have already observed, the genus is in great confiuion, and
nothing persectly satisfactory can be stated respecting it.
