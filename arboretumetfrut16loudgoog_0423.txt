the Entomclogical egerim under the signatius of Rusticus, quoted in the

inseet, and give, also, a method of destroying it: -“ These bllghts warrder

Megarice, residing in Cornwali observes, appears to be spreading condnuslly
into new districts, even where no new trees have been lanted, more espe-
cially in thc bottoms of valleys. The acclivities of h' leit ascende very
slowly; aad orchards in these situations are generally less affected by the
insect than such as are in plains. The writer alluded to (hinlonathan
Conch, aeciantific naturalist) recommends diluted sulphuric acid ae the agent
of destruction. This ie formed, he says, by “ mixing slowly three quartem of
an ouuce of sulphuric aoid with η oz. of water. ln laying it on, care should
be taken not to let it touch the clothes of the operator, iu which it will make
holes. It should be applied all over the bark by means of rege, the only ts
