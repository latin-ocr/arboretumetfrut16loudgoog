'u said, tbat Joseph ol An'mathea, alter the burlal ol Chiist, came tc Eng-
land, attended hy twelve compnninna, to found the first Christian ehurch in
this island ς and, guided by divine impulse, he proceeded ιο Glastonbury l'or
that purpose. It was Christmasday when he arrived at the spot where he·
had been commanded to build a church in honour of the Vir 'n Mary; and,
finding that the nativas did not ap inclined tc believe in ia musion, he
prayed to God tc perform a mirare ιο convince them. His prayer was im·
mediately answered; and, cn striking his staff into the ground, it immedisffl
ahot forth into leaves and blossomi. The legend adds that this thorn is '
in existence, and still blossoms annually on Christum-da . The French
bave a legend, that, cn the day alter the niassoere cf St. olomew, on
August teth, an cld thom in the thurchyard ol St. Innocentio Paria, came
into blossom a second time.

'l'he ts who have written on the -hawthorn are almost aa numerous as
those w o have written on the rose. Ghaueer, in his Ceret eff Lcce, makes
all his eoiut, on May-day, go forth, “ both most and lest, tc fetche the bourie

The Grecis and Romans gethered the May ιο honour ol Flora, to whom the
plant was dedicated, and whose festival began on May-day ; and the Greeks,
even ol' the present time, preserve the memorial of this citatem by hanging a
land of hawthorn flowera against their doors on the lst cs May. ln

lords and ladies os their court, rode out a Maying, froin Greenwiehto Shocter’s

Son aad Situatba The hawthorn will do no good unless planted in a soil
naturally dry and fertile, or that has been rendered so by art. The plant is
never found naturally on a wet aoll; and, if planted on auch a scil, it soon
becomes stunted, and covered with lichena and mosi, The situation should
be airy: hut it will grow either in exposed places, or in such as are sheltered,
and even shadcd, by other trees. ln'caees cf this liind, however, it neither
