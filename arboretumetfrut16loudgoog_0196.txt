Almond trees are, indeed, seldom good hearers: even in Francc, where the
fruit is cultivated as an article of commarca, the tree is considered, on an
average, only to bear a crop once in live years. From the head of the
tree being ο n, the shoots are clothed vnth leaves and biossom buds to
a great impii ao that, when the latter expand, the hranchcs ecem wholly
covered wit chenu acircumstance which is not found in trees having close
dense hands, such as the common hawthom. The alrnond, as a stan-
dard, is one of the rincipal ornaments of British shrubberies and
plantatione in spring, though it is neithera handsomely shaped trec, nor
one of long duration. contemporary blossoming trees are, the apricot, the
sloe, the myrobalan plum, and the cerasus Pseudo-Cerasus. The hloasoma
of all these trees come οιιι before the leaves3 and hence they produce the
best effect when planted among evergreens. The chief distinction between

Pliny, and also the variet of it w 'ch he calls Tuberes 3 and which, as before
observed (p. 675), Mr. niyht considers ιο he the suellen, or peach‚ aimond y

mind, that the aimond and the peach are only one species. The alrnond trec '
ia mentioned in Scripture as one of the choice fmits of Canaan3 and hythe
earlier Roman writers, as well as by Pliny. Turner, and also Gerard, have
treated of this trec, and the latter says that, though it is atrae of hot regions,

Properties and Uter. The wood of the alrnond is hard, and of a reddish
coiour: it 'u used in cabinet-mhing, especially for veneen'ng3 and it is em-
