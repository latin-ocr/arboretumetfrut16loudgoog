Hybrid Chim Rosea, 89 sorta. These rosea are all hybrids between R.
indica and R. gillica: ¹“tbey are all very beautiful, and have that plessing,
glossy,sub-ev een foliage peculiar to the Chinn ¹rose, but make a great
deviation from t at section, in not being perpetual bloomers; in this division
are some of the most beautiful roses known; and, among them, George the
Fourth, raised from seed by T. Rivers, jun, ma rank among the best.
These are also all very robust, and will grow an bloom wellin the most
unfavourable rose soils: their peculiar babit and vivid coloura render them
particularly well adapted for standards.'’

Varieties cf Rhea aba, 25 sorte. The rosea in this section have their

flowers of the most delicate hues imaginable, from the purest white to a
peculiarly vivid rose-colom bnt eo delicate in their gradatione, that no terma

their lliliage is mostly pubescent, and in some varieties large, and very profuse.

verginia, or dimach Roseawsorts. “ The rosea in this division haveall
atih' erect shoots, with dense foliage, tbe flowers are on short erect flower
stalks, having rather a formal appearance ς but, to compensate for this, they are
trim and neat, and are well adopted for small gardens. Many of them differ
in the prett compactsbape of their flowers from all other rosea, and in bril·
liancy and diversit of colour mnnot be surpassed. The spotted, striped, and
marbled rosea in is division are very novel and beautiful, and will he appre-
ciated by those who admim vanegated roses. In France, this is called the
Provine rose, whence the confusion in most rose catalogues with the Pro·
vence rose, the Agatha rose is ol this family, having curled leaves and
pale flowers. Gallie rosea are too lumpish and stiff m their growth for
standards.’'

Cliurbing Rosea, 53 sorta. There are four sections of climbing rosas,
Ayrshire, Sempervirens, Multiflora, and Boursault. The Ayrshire climbin
rosea are all varieties of R. arverrsie5 and most of them have been raised
from seed by Mr. D. Martin of Roae An le, near Dundee. There are 14
varieties, all vigorous growers, making sloots frorn rest. to 20 ft. every
season. The rnost remarkable of these is tbe R. a riga, which is a hybrid
between R. arnensis and R. indica odorhta, and bas the climbing habit and

degree of vigour to those produc by the varietiee of R. arvensis. They are
all quite hardy, and are remarkable for the neatness and elegance of their
flowers. The triom he de Bollwyller is a hybrid between R. sempervlrens
and R. indica odorlta, and has large fragrant llowers. On this division
Mr. Rivers observes: “lt will be something of a novelty to apply climbing
rosea as underwood, but l know of no plant so eligible for elegant under·
growth, in a wilderness near pleasuregrounds, as the varietiee of R. sem·
pervirens: they grow iu every description of soil with great luxuriancee
under the shade of trees they are nearly evergreen3 and, with their beantb
fully sheped and delicately coloured flowers, are calculated to form the
prettiest mass of undergrowth it is possible to conceive. They grow with
