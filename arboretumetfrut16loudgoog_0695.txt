would soon assume adurgy colour, so aa to harmoniae

with the green of the turf ς and, being ss perfectly even and

smooth as the ground on each side, they would offer no

Another mode of supplying water to an

or more, in the evening, once or twice 8 weelr, during very hot westher,
without rislr of injuring the plante.
