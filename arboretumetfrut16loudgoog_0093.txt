next two years, aster whichthe posts and rails are tohe removed ς the branchos
of the farae must then be collected in the hand, snddrawn forward towards
the freld, while the posts and rails are again put up on the plantation side of

by cattle snd sheep, which makes it grow so thick and close, that, by the

fereut forms may be introduced, occasionaliy, to vary the effect, which is
supremely beautrful, especially when the furze isin bloom. (Gard.Mag.,

As a upliciter lo young trees, the furze is sometimes sown where acorns,
bccch masts, or chestnuts, arc to be sown, or young trees are to be planted,
in order to shelter them for a few years, till they grow up, and have sufficient
smength to shclter one another ; when they will overtop the furze and de·
stroy it. 'fitis ractice has been adopted to some extent in the government
