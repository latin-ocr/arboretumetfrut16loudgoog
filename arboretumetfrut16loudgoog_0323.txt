whether lor the rose, or sor any other tree or shrub, either in Britain or ou
the Continent. The most general method adopted, on the Oontinent, ol pcr-
forming it on the roseis that indicated byfig. ⁵39, in which the two cuts in
the barh sorm the letter T reversed, alreadp detailed; whereas in Englaad
they sorm the letter Tuprigbt. Either mo e may be adopted according to
the season: in spring budding, the slit made iu the form oia T reversed
(thus, g) is the best 3 but in August, or summer, budding, the T siit ought to
be mede creet ; because the junction, at this sesson,talres place by the descent
os the sap; whereas in spring it is effected chiefly by its secent. Where the
shoots produced from the stock are wealr, the buds may be inserted in themain
stem; more especially if the stock is not very old, and the barlr hard. Some·
times, buds inserted even in August will push the same sonem more especially
il the roots of the stoclr have been well supplied with water: but, whether they
push the first season or the next, the points of the shoots produced ought to

branch out ; because, when only one long single shoot is produced from each
bud, it islinble to be broken off close ιο the stock, hythe wind. Bndding
early 'ur tbe season succeeds best on young wood; and, during August and
September, it succeeds best on oid wood. Buds of the China rose and
its varieties, put in in July, frequently flower the same asason. Twelve

rosea, Renksias, Noisettes, &e ln general, two buds arc sufficient formay

with equal vigour; and, ol' course, the one soon robe and destroys the
other. The bast ligature which confines the buds should be pretty eight: and
s laurei leaf may be slightly tied on with it, in such a way as to sorni an
arch over chabod, to defend it from the sun aud rain, both of which are as
prejudicial as the air. 'l'he ligaturas may be sacred, in moist seasons, siler
