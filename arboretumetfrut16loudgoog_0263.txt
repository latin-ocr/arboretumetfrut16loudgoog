able, that scarcely any bramble-berriae, or blaclrberries, as they are commonly
called, were to be found ri in October. This species is considered asbeing
more common than any o the other brambles‚ aud also as attaining a greater
aize. lt is this sort which occurs most frequently in English hedges; audit
has been justly remarked by H. C. Watson (Outlt'nes, da, .1’37.), that
brambles are more abundant, and much liner, iu the hedges in ngland‚ than
they are in Scotland3 and that in the Highlands they form only a secondary
feature in the physio omy ol vegetation. The cause why the brambles are
so much finer m Eng and thau the are in Scotland is not alto ther owing
to the superiority of the English ciimate, but artly to the hedges in Scot-
land being formed solely ol the hawtborn, an kept within much lesa bounds
than they arc in England. The bramble is never planted in Scotland, and is
only occasionally found in hedgcs, in consequence ol' having been sown there
by birds. lt is always found to prosper best on a soil somewhat dry and
gravelly3 and, accordingly, Switzer, when speaking ol choosi asorl and
situation sor a rineyard, recommends looking out for oue wheret e bramble
is abundant and vigorous.
