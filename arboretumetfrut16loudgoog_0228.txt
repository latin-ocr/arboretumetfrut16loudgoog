'ttwas found by Pallas in abundance on Mount Caucasus, where it differed
from the European variety in the leaves aod llowers coming out together.
and in the leaves being more cordate and acuminata. The tree is very general
in Fraoce, particularly in the mountainous districts. lt is very common iu
the neighbourhood of Ste. Lucis, whence its name of bois de Ste. Lude.
Trees of it are sometimes found, in that neighbourhood, with trunks 4li. in
circumference. The tree is very generally cultivated inE land,asan orua-
mental plant. lt was introduced in 1714, but was known ong before, from
the circumstance, es Gerard informs us, of “the cunnin Frencb
making bracelets, chains, and such like triding toys, of the fruit, w ich they

send into England, smeared over with some old sweet compound or other,
and heresell untoour curicus old lad1es and gentlewomen, for rare aud strange

Properties ond Uret. he wood of the mahaleli is hard, brono, veined,
sud susceptible ofahigh olish. lts sluell is less powerful, und moreagree·
able, when it isdry, than when the sap is iu it. ln a dr state it weighs 59lb.
loz. per cubic foot. In France, it rs much sought verb cabinetmakers,
on account of its fragrancc, hardness, and the fine polish which it receives;
and it issold by them green, in thin veneers, because in that state it does not
crach, or, at least, the slits, or chiults, are less perceptible. In the Vosges, in
the neighbourhood of the Abbey of Ste. Lucie, agrest deal of this wood is
sold to tarners, and for the manufacturc of tobaccopipes and souis-boses.
ln Lorraine, the wood of the mahaleb is often confounded with that of the
C. Padus ; and the latter, also a handsome wood, is glan sold for theformer.
The leaves are powerfully fragrant, more particular y when dried: they are

ily eaten by cattle and sheep, and they are used for giving flavour togame.
he kernel of the nut is employed by persumere to scent soap. The wood

ashedges. One of the pnncipaluses ιιι which the lant isat present em·
ployed in France is, as astock on which to graft the ' , rent kinds of fruit·
bearing cherries ; for which it has the advantages of growing on a very'poor
soil; of coming into sap 15 days later than the common wild cherry, by
which nreans the grafting season is prolonged; and, lastly, df dwarfing the
planta grafted on it. In British gardens, it is partly used for this purpose,
but principally as an omruncntal shrub or low trae. Asin the case of other
dwarf species of a genus which will unite toa tall robust-growing species,
the mahaleb, when grafted on the common wild cherry (C. sylvestris), grows
to a larger trec than when on its own roots.

Soil, Sitaolioa, dc. The mahaleh will grow in any poor soil that is dry,
even in the most arid sends and naked challrs ι and, as it forms a low bushy
tree which is capable of resisting the wind, it may be planted in an exposed
situation. When young plants are to be raised from seed, the fruit is sown
