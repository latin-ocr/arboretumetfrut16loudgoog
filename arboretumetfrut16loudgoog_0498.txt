Β. prostratum, and several other botanical species, indicated, in the following
peges, by an a in parentheses, between the generic and specific names, are
essentia! y one and the mma thing. We have arrived at this conclusion, hom
a study of the planta in the very excellent collectione of this genus which are

Geoggroplry. 'l'he red sumant, including those forms, or botanical species,
which we have mentioned above as likely to be only varieties of it, is e native
of many parts of Europe, of the north and west of Asia, and of North
America. In Britain, R. ritbrnm, R. alpinum, and R. petreum are found in
woods or hedgee, in rariora situations, where, in all probability, the seoda
have been carried by birds. ln Ireland, the red currant is also found wild in
various places, aa it is in Sweden. ln North America it is found as far north
as the arctic circle ς and it is frequent in Greece, Caucasus, Siberis, and 'lar-
tary a and, according to Royle, a species nearly allied to 11. peuaelum (which
we consider to be one of the forms of the red currant) is found in alterations
from 8000 ft. to 10,000 e. above the level of the sea.

Hotory. There is no positive evidence that the nicients were acquainted
with the red currant, any more than that they were with the gooseberry; itis
difficult to believe that the currant which must have been conspicuous when
ripe, and the grateful acid teste of which must have been found refreshing in
a warm elimate, could escape the notice of the inhabitants of the countries
in which it was produced. The probability is, that the ancients knew this
fruit, though modern botanists have not been able to identify it among the
plants mentioned by Greek and Roman authors. ln France, the red currant
seems to have attracted notice long before the gooseberry, and, till a very
late period, to have been much more valued than that fruit. Both seem to
have been first im roved by cultivation in Holland; whence the principal va·
rieties in Europe have been procured. ln England, the currant is mentioned
by Gerard, who distinguishea three sorte, the red, the white, and the black,
and gives their French and German names. None of them, he says, grow
vrild with us; bnt they are to be found growin plentifnlly in many garriens,
sunnin striduit
mencement of thc present century, a great muninime siarts haue been raised
from seed3 and there are now ten excellent kinds in British gardens3 the
best of which are, Wilmot’s red, the Dutch white, and the large champagne.

Propertier ond Uret. The medicinal properties of the canant consist
in its allaying thirst, and lessening an increased secretion of the bile;
and‚in coti uence of the first of these properties, it is frequently ςίιοο
in ferere. he juice makes a pleasant aoid in punch; and, mixed
with water, forms a common and very eeable beverQe, under the name of
caude grosseilles, in Paris. Sirop e rosseilles is another well-known
French preparation of this fruit; and, in ngland, currant jelly is equally
well known. Currants are employed for culinary purposes in tarts and pud·
dings; bu't they are usually mixed with other fruits, and are seldom,if ever,
used in an unripe state. When ripe, they malm au excellent'wine, which is
agrem favourite in farm-hausen, and with most persons who reside in the
country, and like sweet home-mede wines. The best varieties are brought to
the dessert, and are much esteemed by some. The season when the fruit
ripe is abolit the end of dune, or the beginning of Jnly; and, by having plante
trained on the north face of a wall, or by coverin the trees or espaliers
growin as bushes in the open garden with matting, they may be kept fit for
the tabie tul Christmas.

The Propogation‚ Cultura, de, of the currant, for its fruit, vrill be found
given at length in our Euryelopodio os Gordeaing, and in our Subarboa Gor·

denen As an ornamental ahrub, the common rontine of culture prescribed for
the genus may be followed.
