and fragments of gardan pots to be mixed with the soil in which heaths are
grown: hut the practice seems to have been first introduced (probably before
1820) hy Mr. James Niveu, who was many years a collector at the Cape, and
who died ιιι Penuycuick, near Edinburgh, in 1827. (See Garri. Mag, vol. ii.

of glass or bomds during winter.

kile Theatment (μορε Heatlw ar kalf-hurd Shusha is a subject on which
we can denve hut little assistance, either from hooks, or srom the experiente
of practical men. Mr. M‘Nab isoi opinion that, in the climate of Edrnhurgh,
the Ca eheethao ht never to be taken out of doors, but should be kept
iu the house, even uring summer, giving them plenty ο1 air,andkeepin them
cool dunng winter. lt is commonly supposed, he says, that turning heaths
out of doors, for four or five months ιιι summer and autumn, makes them
hardier, and enablea thern better ιο stand the winter; hut he very properly
differs lrom this opinion, findin from experience that, when hmths and other
green-house lants are kept in tire house during summer, the young wood gers
better ripen ,andra cons uently, better able to restat cold m wruter. he
greatest careisr uisite to eep the house in which heaths aregrownwell
vmrtilatedr for w ich purpose the glass of the rool and sides should he
made to open; end the lanta should never be so near as to touch each other
with the extremrties oi their shoots: on the contrary, they ought always to be
ιιι least 3in. or tin. apert, in order ιο admit ol' a free circulatron os arr round
each. “ Except iu cases of high wind or heav rain, both top and lront

lights should be open night and dayy and, besides watering the earth in the
pots ireely when they require it, t e plants should be well watered over·

ead with the gardan engvne every day, ancl, iithe westher be hot and
dry, this operation should he erlormed twice every day; namely, both morning
and evening.” “The chi objection,” Mr. Marnock observes, ⁸⁴ ιο heaths
and other green house plante being kept in the house in summer is, that,
being exposed ιο the sun, the earth in the pots becomes dry, and the extremes

’ of hest and cold, wet and dry, ιο which the roots are thence subjected, cause

the planta ιο assume a brown and unhealth appearancet aud, generally, the
leaves on the lower branches to sall off. Tdese evils may, however, be effec-
tually prevented b using double pots, the empty pot which is intended to
form a screen for tle other which contains the plant, being sufficiently large
ιο receive the latter within it, so that the tops ο1 both are nearly on a level.
lhave practised this mode sor the last three years, both with stove and reeu-
house plants3 and, during thedry summer 011832, IhadatBretton all at
least 100 ο1 the latter in pots, protected in this way.'' (Garri. rksag, volx.
p. 32.) When heaths are attackedb aphidas, which they very seldom
are, a little tohacoo smoke sor two nigdts m succession will destroy them.
lt isslways better to apply the smoke two οι· three times, if necessary, in
small uantities, than the same quantity oltohacco allat once, because there is
less ridr os injuring the planta. When heaths in pots huppen to be ‘srozen
during winter, thereis nothing more injurium ιο them thau the apphcation
oi lire heat to such an extent as ιο thaw the soil All that ought to be
done ia, bj covering the sashes with mats, or hy other means, toprcvent
the increase of the srost, and leave the soil to be thawedh the natural re-
turn os genial westher. ln the Botanic Gardcn of Edinburgli, we believe, lire
hest, or artificial hest of any kind, is seldom or never a lred ιο the heath·

oslthe Shellield Botanic bardenwih be found in the Gardmcr'r Megarice,
