Geoghnphy. The ivy is a native of Europe, froin the south of Sweden to
the Mediterranean Sea, and from lreland to Siberia 3 but only in woods, and
under the sbelter ol trees and bushes, iu either the colder or the hotter dia-
tricts of thia extensive region. It is found in the north ol Aftien, the west ol'
aaa, the mountainous regiona of lndia, and also in Japan and Cbina, but not
in North or South America, or 'tn Australia. The variety with llow berriea,
Royle informs us, “ is the most common in the Himalayas, an may-be seen
clinging to the noch,¹ and clas ing the oak; affording, froin its pleosing associa- ’
dona, glad recognition to thelluropean traveller.’' (Illnrt, p. 233.) ln Britain,
the ivy is always found growing ιιι a mbetantialsorl, where it ean be ampl
supplied with nourishment, and where its roots ean penetrate to such a depth
as to he able to obtain abundant moisture for the leaves, when the plant has
attained its greatest height, and is in a flowering state.

Proper-tier aad Uret. The whole plant is aromatic; aad a very fragrant
rasin exudes from the old stems when brnised, from which is obtained the
chemical principle liederine. Ity was formerly included in the Britiah
Materia tredico, as it was in that of the Greeks, and stillis in that os
India. The berries are emetic and purgative, and the substance called
hederine, which is now in use in indis, ts said to be aperient, resolvative,
and balsamic. The berries, as already observed, are greedily caten hy
several birds. Sheep and deer are fond of the leaves and small branchos,
which, before the introduction of green tropa, afforded a useful resource
when the ground was covered with spow. Cato directa that, in a scarcity
os hay, οι· the dried shoots estrees, cattle should be l'oddered with the
green branchos ol' ivy. The wood is solt and porous3 and, in Switzer·
land, and in other parts of the south of Europe, it is used hy the tumen
and, in tbin slices, ιο filter liquida. The roots are employed by leather·
