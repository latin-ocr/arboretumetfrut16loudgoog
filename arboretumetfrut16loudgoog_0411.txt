Lindley, alter dercrrhing it, says: “Nature aeeme to have intended it to
brave the utmoat inclemency ol climatey for, in ita own country, in the
earlieste ring, the leaves, while still delicate and tender, are clothed with
a thick ite coating cl wool; and the flowere themselves ere co deeply
immereed inan ample covering οἰ the same material, ae to bid defiance to eren
Tartarieneold. But‚inproportionae the extent os thedietribntionof the plant
descende towards the pleine, or aa the eeeaon os warm wenther advancee, it
throwe odiu fleecy coat, and et length becomes ee nahed, and as glittering
with green, ιι the trees which have never had euch rigour to endure. ln
England, it scarcely acquiret any part οἱ ite natural woolhneee, but ia ae
naked aa our common bearn tree.’‘ (Bor. ch.‚ t. 16⁵⁵.) There are plante
of thie species in the (iarden of the Horticultural Society, and m the
arboretnrn of Measre. Loddigee ς but their general appearance reeme to uc
much more like that of an Aria then os a Pyrus.
