The best scientific work on the genus 11ὸο0 10 considered to be the Ilotarum
Monographr'a 01 Dr. Lindley, in onevol. sv0,pub1ished in 1819, in which above
100 sorta 010 described, and some 01 ι11010 ured. ACollects'on 1011010000οΝ0-
ture, by Mica Lernence, contains figures o 90 sorta, and 10 0 valuable popular
work. Aa article 00 the Scotch 10000, 11γ 1111. Sabine, in Harl. Ἰ1001.,101.11.,
contains a copious account 01 the principal varietiea which were raised, pre-
110001γιο the date 011110 plepem from the Rosa spinosissima. The lastBritish

omitting the first section, Simplicildlis, now made a separate genus by Dr.
