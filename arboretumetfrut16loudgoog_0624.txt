When Cape heaths are planted out, either against an open wall, or ou a bed
to be protected during winter, the soil should be previously prepared, mixed
with stones, and placed on a substratum of drainage, in conformity with atr.
M‘Nab’s directions for preparing the soil, aad growing and managing heatha
in pots. The planta turned out should,atleast, be of four or five υπς’
growth; because it is found from experiente, that stout planta ot' half- y
s ies of every kind of shruh will beer more cold the first winter, when
panted in the open ground, than wealc planta. Aa hesths require a free oir-
culation of air around them at all seaaons, they will probably succeed better
when lanted in a bedof soil in the open gardan, and protected by a movable
roos, when planted against a wall: but this movable roof must consist
chiefly of gissa, ou account of many of the species being in a growing and
flowering state durin the winter season. We baveno doubt that,in various
parts of the south oi England, most of the sorte enumerated 'm App. llL, if
thoroughly established in the open ground, would uire ιιο protection what·
ever. The branchos would exclude the frost from e soil; aud, if the topa
were ocossionally killed down to within 2ft. or 6ft. of the roots, the plante
would s ring out again the following season, and soon recover what they lusd
lost. he south-east side of a natural hill would be the most suitahle sittia-
tion for such an ericetum, provided care were taken in early spring, when the
plante were covered in the morning with hoarfrost, to thaw it off hy watenffi
them before sunrise; hut, ιιι ituations wherethis recautioncannotbeattend

are ept under glass during winter, are turned out into the perterre of hardy
heaths during summer, “ where they merally doner, grow vigorousl

form themselves into handsome husiy plsnts.” The tenderest md’mffl

difficult to ropagate of these are taken up in autumn, repotted, and replaced
in the heatiiery; while the more hardy and easily prop speeies are'

Nursery is persuad that anumberof ape hestiis would stand theopen air
in lreland‚ without the slightest protection whatever ; more especially on the
sea coast. He has grown in a hams, 6 st. high behind, and 6 in. high in frout,
without any means of artificial lient whatever, a number of sorts to a high
degree of perfection. The hed is composed of three layers: the lowest of
loose stones, 6 in. thick; the one over rt of fine, sihed, rotted lnam, mixed with
ssnd, pest soil being there very scarce3 and the third, or surface stratum, of
ssndy pest, 16 in. or 18 in. deep. The planta are turned out of the pots into
this sorly and, during summer, they require frequent watering, all pooeible air
on temperate days, and shading οιι scorching sunn ones. The shadingis
effectedh amat, and the vennlation hy tilting up tieglass at both ends, so
as to produces thorough current of air. ln winter, the same attention to air
is given, but ιιο water whatever. The plante are screened from rain at all
seasons, and well matted up during severe frosts in winter, but no kind of ar·
tilicial heat is apphed (See Gard. Mag, vol. x. p. 206.) Mr. Rutger, during
his residente in Comwall, having a number of duplicates of Cape heaths,
planted a clump of them ¹in the open air, which succeeded admirpbly ‘with
