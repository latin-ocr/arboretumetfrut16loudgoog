The llowera are asten by the hill people‚ and formal into ajell by European
visiters. The leaves of R. campanulktum, being used ss a snunlby the natives
of ludis, are imparted from Gnshmere, under the names of booles-kssmeeree
(Cashmere snuff) and burg-i·tibbut (Tbibct leaf), though easily procurable
within the Britiab territorias. It is remarkable that De Candolle mentione
the lo ent in the United Sintes, for a similar purpose, of the brnwn
daut whic adheret to the petioles of kelmias and rhododendrons. Tbe
leaves of R. le iddtum (a species not yet introduced into Europe) are highly
fragrant, and oia stimulant nature.’' (lunt, p. 219.) The culture of all the
species is nearly the same: the all require earth, or, at least, thrive
best in it; and some of them will not live wi out it. They may all be pro·
' pagated by cuttings of the growing shoots, planted iu fine saud, aad covered
witha ghas, οι by layers3 but the best planta ofall the species are procured
from seed. The vanaties can, of course, onlybe continuedb cuttings or
layers; and the stools for these uire to be planted in beds of pent, which
should be kept tolerably moist. e aeeds, if ripened in this country, should
be sowu soon aster gatbering; and those imported from America, immediately
on bei received; because, though the seeds of all the Ehieaceoe will retain
the ri principle for several years (see p. 1100.), yet the longer theyase
kept out of the soil, the less tkely they are to germinate, and the greater
will be the risk of losin some of them. They should be sown iu ots or
bores, or iu a bordes sh ed from the direct influence of the sun; aud kept in
a uniform state of moisture, aud protected from the frost. ln sowing, the
surfnce of the soil should previously be made quite smooth,and eutly pressed
down, or watered till it bas settled to a level surface; andaiter the seeds
have been equally distributed over this surface, they should be covered with
no more soil tban is barely requisita to conceal them from the eye. Seeds
sown in autumn will germinate in the following spring, aud befit for transplant-
ing into nursery lines or pots by the autumn, or hythe spring of the following
year. These directions will apply generally to al the species,but aremare

nated by a withered tip, or yellow glan& and terminal, corymbose‚ aborry
flowers. cultivated in sandy psat, ept rather maist, and propagated by
layers, seeds, or cuttings. Under this genus Professor D. Don bas included
the Asklea, which, however teohuically correct, pears to us injudicious
in apractical point of view; and, though we bave allowed bis arrangement
in this article, yet we have indicated two sentinam containing the Indian
or tendet, and the Asiatic and American or hardy, auulsas, which those who
ctdtivate extensive collectione of these shrubs may, if they choose, consider
aa constituting the genus Azalea as heretofore. Such persons, therefore,
