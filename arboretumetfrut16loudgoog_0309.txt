If tbe red rose de Provins be used, the odis said to imbibe no odour ; but, if

wascelebrat among the ancients. Pliny says that, accordingto Homer, rosea
were macerated for their oil in the time of the Trojans. The oil is chiefly
used for the bair, and is generally sold in persumers’ shops, botb in France
and England, under the neme of filcile antique de rore.
