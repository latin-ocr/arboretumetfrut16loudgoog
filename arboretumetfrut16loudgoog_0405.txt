also been found by the French gardeners, throw the scions sooner into

will not prove quite so durable. When dwarf trees are required, the pear is

about the middle ol the last century, by Gordon, the author ol the Gardenei’r
Dicdum, there were standands, in 1806, with trunks above a loot in dia·
meter, and heads in proportion. These, judging lrom the suckers that used to

first year by the scion would be such as entirely to overtop ti
shoots ol tlie same year roduced by the, adyoinlng thorn stum sy and,
by carehil removal of suciiers, and training for a year or two, the hedge
would soon be furnished with handsome vigorous standard pear trees. This
we conceive to be the only practical mode ol introducing standard pesr trees
into a hedge already some years plantedr but when, on planting a hedge,
it is determined to have standard pear trees in it, we would recom-
mend standands on wild pear stocks to be procured from tlis nursery, and
planted at the same time ss the hedge lants. There ia no such thing as
