L’Ile ds Boarboa Rosea, 38 sorte. “This is a most beautiful section,
scarcely known in this country. Theo ' 'nal, or common, l'lle de Bourbon
rose was sent to France, in leta, from e Mauritius, by the brother of M.
Noisette, a nurseryman at Paris. Itis semidouhlc,and seems to have the
charactera ofa distinct species. It bears seeds in great profusion ς but, though
thousands of seedlings have been raised, the produce of good varieties bas
been but in small proportion to the bad. Like the China rosea, of which they
hare been considered a division, they are perpetual bloomers; but they have
a luxuriance and gracefulness quite their own. The perfect and elegant form
of their flowers, the extremely delicate tints in some, and vivid rose-colour in
others, will soon establish them in the favour of the rose amateur: as stan·
dards, they grow most luxuriantly,are quite hardy, and blootn iu greater
perfectiori late in autumn than any other perpetual rose.’'

varietiee of this interesting section are novelties. From their evergreen, ahin-
ing, neat foliage, and elegant growth, they are quite worthy a place in the
garden of the rose amatcur. In cold soils, they vvrll require a warm situation
and raised border: but they are much hardier worked on the dog rose3 and,
as half standards, are beautiful ; requiring the same treatment as standard tea-
acented roses.''

or wild rose of Scotland; and they form so gay an assemblage among May
floram, that a clump or border ought to be devoted to them in every flower-
gprdep. The shape of the flower is peculias and similar, being nearly

lllr. Rivers has also iven a synopsis of variegated roses, consisting of 42
sorts. He adds that tire sections “ of rosea are now ao well defined, that
each ought to have its department: a clump of hybrida, for their gorgeous
colours in June and Ju1y; of perpetuale, for their fragrante in the arrtumnal
months3 of Noisettes,for their el ce and abundante of flowera; of Scotch
rosea, for their preeocity and humbe rowth3 and of climbing roses, for pillars,
which should he planted in a very rich soil, as they will then put forth strong
ceutral branches, of 8ft. or lon. in length, which, when fastened to the
atahes, will furnish a plentiful supply of lateral blooming shoots for many sea-
sons. Climbing rosea will cover a sloping bank, as their flexible branches
ean be pegged to the ground in any directior, and will form abeautiful carpet
of foliage and flowers; the dark arimson and white varieties blending with
pecoliar elegance. The perpetual, lle de Bourbon, jand Noisette rosea, from
their vigorous habits and tendency to flower, may be made fine objecta for
ornamenting hails, δια, during the autumna} months ; for this purpose, they
should be put into large pots, and well furnished with surface manure, and
plenty of water in summer: their bloasoms ought, also, to be cut off just before

This line autumnal rose,when forced, and blooming 1n March or Apul, is
most beautiful: its too short llower stalks are lengthened by this mode of
culture3 its flowers are erect (nnlilte many other forced rosea), and lose none
of their colour or fragrance by the excitement they have undergone. For all
