nativas oilSibena, like most other Siberian planta, vegetate early in spring ς
and their delicate pinnated foliage, of a yellowish green, independently
altogether ol' their llowers, makes a fine appearance abunt the middle ol
Aprrl; or, in mild reasons, even as early aa the middle of March. The
donus, which are of a brightyellow, pear about the eud of April, in the

just began to expand. The yellow eolour prevails in every part of the
planta of this genua, even to the roota; and, were it not that thia colour is
ιο abundant in common productione of the vegetable kin dom, there ean he

singular or unique, among what is natural or general, produces, by contram,
ι striking effect ; interrupta the ordinary train of impressionay and reeulls the
mind of the spectator from the heauties of nature to thore of art.
