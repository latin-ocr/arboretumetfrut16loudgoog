netrable and the most durable ofall vegetable fences; and rt has this great ad·
rantage orer deciduous-leared trees and sbrubs, that it is seldom liable to be
attached by insecta ς and,if ahorn, the outer surfaca becomes impenetrable
eren to birds, who cannot build their nesta in it. ln these points os view,
it is decidedly the hest hedge, both for the ianuar and the gardener; but, if
the saggot wood produced by the hedge is a greater object than the advantages
just mentioned, which itis income parts of Englsnd where fuel is scarce,
the hawthom is preferable to the holly, the latter producinqbut short annual
shoots. The obyection to the holly, as 3 hedge plant, is t eslowncss of its
growth; but against this must be set its great durability 3ηά the other adran-
tages which it possessas. Besides, by a httle extra care in preparing the soil,

No plant endures the shears better than the holly. A hedge of it may be
carried to a great he' ht; and, consequently, it is well litted for situations
where strength and ihelter are required. lt luxuriatos most in rich sandy
loam, although there are few soils rn which it will not grow. Alter planting,
the holly makes hut very-indifferent progress sor a few years; but, aher rt
becomes established in the ground, or about the third or fourth year after
lanting,no sence whatever will outgrow the holly.” (Plani. Kal, p. 357.)

Bandrillart speaks of holly hedges, in France, that are upwards of two
centurias old: those at Tyningham were planted about the latter end of
the serentcenth century.
