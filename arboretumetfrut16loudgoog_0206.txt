on account of the rambling habit of its roots, and the numerous suckers ey
throw up; arrd because it ts apt to get naked below, from the tendency of the
shoots to grow upright and without branches. These upright shoots make
excellent walling-sticka which, accordingly, throughout Europe, arc more fre-
quently taken from this tree than froin any other. They are furnished with
sharp thorns, which produce numerous thrckly set knots. ‘⁸ The berk '¹ as

Its juice is extretuely viscid; ao that the fnrit requires the addition of a little
water in order to admit of expression. The juice of the ripe fruit is said to
enter largely into the manufacture of the cheapcr kinds of port wina; ancl,
when properly fermentcd, it makes a wine strongly resembling new port. ln
France, a dnnk is made by fennenting the frrut with a certain quantity of
water: it is acid and astringent, more especially if the fruit has been gatherffl
