In tle Ecst, the rose has always been a favourite with the poete. They
represent the nightingale as sighing for its love 3 and many beautiful verses
are derived from this fable. “ ln a curicus fragment by the celebrated
Persian poet Attar, entitled Buldrd Namelr, The Boolr of the N' htingale, all
the birds appear before Solomon, and charge the nightingsle wit disturbing
their rest, by the broken and plaiutive atrains which he warbles forth all the
night in a sort of frenzy and intoxication. The nightingale is summoned,

uestioned, and acquitted by the wise lting; because the bird assuras him,
t athis vehement love for the rose drives hun to distraction, and causes him
to break forth into those passionate aud toucbing complaints which are laid
to his charge.'' (The Lauguage os Facere, p. 116.) The Persians also essert
that ‘⁴ the nightingale‚ in spring, flutters around the rose bushes, utteris
incessant complaints, till, over wered by the strong scent, he drops stupili
on the ground.” (Itis.) ΜΓ, ivers, in the Gord. Mag, vol. x. p. 133,men·
tions that Sir John Malcolm told him that, whsa in Persia, he had once
breakfasted on an immense heup, or rather mount, of rosea, which the Per-
sians had raised in honour of him.

The Turlrs believe that rosea sprang from the perspiration of Mahomet:
for which reason, they never tread upon a rose leaf, or suffer one to lie on
the ground ; they also sculpture a rose on the tombstones of semeles who die
unmarried. There are many legenda related of rosea iu the Esst. The story
of the learned Zeb, who intimated bya rose leaf that he might be received
into the silent academy at Amadan, is well known. The vacant place for
which he applied having been filled up before his arrival, the president inti·
mated this to him by filling a glass so full of water, that a single additional
drop would have made it run over; but Zeb contrived to place the petal of
arose so delicately on the water as not to disturb it in t e least,and was
rewarded for his ingenious allusion hy instant admission into the society.
According to the Hindoo mythology, Pagods Siri, one of the wives of Vish-
nu, was found in arose. ι

Tire Rcse rucsclm celebrated in tle Catholie cruror. “Marullus tells a story
of a holy virgin, named Dorothes, who suffered martyrdom in Caesarea, under
the goverumeut of Fabricius, and who converted to Christianity a scribe
named Theophilus, by sending him some roses, in the winter time, out of
Paradise. A olden rose was considered so honourablea present, that none
but crowued heads were thought worthy either to give or to receive it.
Rosea of this kind were sometimes consecrated by the popes on Good Friday,
and given to such potentates as it was their particular interest or wish to
losd with favonrs; the flower itself being an emblem of the mortality of the
body, and the gold of which it was composed cf the immortality of the soul.''
(Lindi. Ros. Mcmg, pref. xv.) ln an old mosaic, in the church of St.
Susan, at Rome, Charlemagne is represented kneeling, und receiving from St.
Petere standard covered with roses. The custom ο blessing the rose is still
preserved in Rome, and the day ou, which thecereruony is performed is called
Dmuim'cc in Itosd. The rose was always considered as a mystical emblem by
the Catholic church; and, as Schlegel observes, it enters into the composition
of all the ornaments of Gothic churches, in combinatiou with the cross. The
secl of Luther was a rose. Iu 530, St. medard, Bishop of h'oyom instituted
a festival st Salency, his birthplace, for adjudging auuirally the prize of a
crown ofroses to the girl who should be acknowledged by all her competitore
to be the most amiable, modest, ancl dutiful in the village3 and he had the
pleasure of crowning his own sister aa the first rose queen. This custom was
continued to, the time of Medeam de Geniis, who, in the first volume of her
Thisbe d'E‘darctr'orr, has written a beautiful little drama, entitlcd La Rosea
de Sclency, on the subject. lu the middle agea, the knights atn tournament
wore a rosc embroidered on their sleeveS, ns an emblem that gentleneas
should accompany courage, aud that beauty was the reward of valcur. About
this period, the rose was considered so precisus in France, that, iu several
parts of the country, none but the rich and powerlbl were allowed to cultivate
