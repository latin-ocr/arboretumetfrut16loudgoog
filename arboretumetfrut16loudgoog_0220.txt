Propogatioa aad ctum. The common wild cherry (0. sylvestristp, when
grown for stoeks for grafting on, or for planting out with a view to e pro-
duction of timber, is almost always raised from seed3 but, as the roots throw
up suckers in great abundance, these suckers might be used aa plants; or
cuttings of the roots might be emplo ed for the same purpose; oratoola might
be formed, and treated like those o the plum. (See p. 690.) When planta
are to be raised from seed, the cherries should be gothered when ripe, aad
either sown immediately with the llesh on, iucurring the riak of their being
eaten by birds or wermin, especially mice, during the autumn aud wiatcr; or,
what is preferable, they may be mixed with four times their bulk of saod,and
kept in a ebed or cellar, being turned over frequently, till the January or Fe·
bruary following. They may then be sown in beds,and covered with about
half an inch or an inch of light mould. Great care must be taken that the
seeds do not s rout while in the heap ς because, uulike the horaechestnut,
the acorn, an some other fruita, the cherry expande its cotyledone at the
same time that it protrudes its radicle; and when both are developed before
sowing, the probability is, that the germinated seeds will not live; beeauae
the cotyledone, in sowing, are unavotdably covered with soil, whereas nature
intended them to be exposed to the light. The stroagest planta, at the end
of the first seaaon, will be lflin. or more in height, aad may be drawn out
from among the others, and transplanted into nurserylines ; and, aher they
have stood thesea year, they may be grafted or budded.

Prumng tle cterry thee, whether in a young or old state, ought always to
be performed in the mouth of August or beginning of September, and at no
other season3 because it has been found by experiente, ruore especially by
Mr. Sang, who appears to have been the first to record the fact, that, when

bark ia injured,a flo’w of gum is almost the certain consequenc'e, and thiais
almost as certainly the commencement of the decay of the trec.

AccidenttondDiseatea The cherry is not particularly liable to have its
branches broken by high winda or snow storms; but, as a fruit tres, its
branches are frequently broken by carelessness in those who gather the fruit.
'l'he principal disease is the flowing of the gum, which, when once it has com·
menced, w ether naturally, or from an occidental wound, generally continues
till the tree dies: this it does b degrees, one brauch or limb at a time, its
decay being more or less rapi , according to the vigour of the tree. The
thrush and the blackbird, it is 'well known,·feed on chen-iem and the wood-

water, accelerate the decay of the heartwood of the tree; but it ia a mistake to
suppose, as man do, that the decay originates with the woodpecker‚ who
gets the credit 0¹7 making the holes out of sheer mischief, or for amusement;
the truth bein , that decay has commenced, and that he is only in search of
his goos} lphich consiste of the larvae which have already begua to eat the
