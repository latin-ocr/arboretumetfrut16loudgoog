the same manner as cider, see p. 894. The pear trees for producing the fruit
should be planted in rows, not lesa than 18 yards asunder, ιο allow the air
to have free access to the trees. The ears should be gethered before they
begin to fall; and the should be grounl as soon as possible. Perry will not
