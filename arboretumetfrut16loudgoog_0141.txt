As an ornamental trae, when full-grown, according ιο Gilpin, the acacia is
an elegant,and osten avery beautiful, objectt whether rt seathers to the ground,
as it sometimes does, or is adorned with a light foliage herging from the
sboots: but its beauty, he adds, is frail; aud “it is· of all trees tha least
able to endure the blast. ln some sheltcred spot, it tnay ornament egerden 3
but it is by no means qualitied ιο adorn a country. Its wood is oi so brittle
a texture, especially when it is encumbered with a weight of fol· ,that you
oen never depead upon its aid in filling up the pert you wish. ebt-auch
you admira today may be demolished to-nrorrow. The missortune is, the
acacia is not one os those grand objecta, lilre the oah, whose dignity is osten
increased by ruin. It depende on its beauty, rather than onita grandeur,
,which is a quality ruore hable ιο injury. 1 may add, however, in its favour,
. that, if it be easily injured, it repaire the injury more quicltly than any other
trae. Few trees melre so repid agrowth.’' (Gilpin’s Forett Sccnery, i. p. 72.)

On the whole, it would appear, that, in Britain,the locust is only calculated
l'or l'arourable climates an good soilst and that, when grown in these with a
view ιο profit as timber, it should be cut down at the end oi 30 οι· 40 years„
Perhaps it may prove more profitable as a copae vead: for producing feucing
stuli, or fuslt but, eren for these pu ses, we feel confident that it cannot
be grown sor many years together, wit advantage, on the seme soil. We do
not think it at all aurtable for hop-poles3 because, evan when crowded together
in nursery lines, it cannot be got ιο grow straight, aud it almost always loses
ita rufin shoott besides, if it did grow taught, thero is uo evidence ιο prore
that stahes made from young locust trees, and used for hep-poles, ere more
dtuable than stakes oi the ash, chestnut, or any other tree. lt is worthy of ¹
notice, that Cobbett, apparently without ever haring seen a hop-pole made oi'
locust, boldly affirma that the trae isadmirably adopted for that u set
that trees from his nursery, aller bein t years planted on Lord uor's
estate at Coleshill, were “ fit for hop-poies, that will last in that capacity for
20 or 30 years at the least ’' (Woodlattde, y 380.) 3 that such poles are worth
a shilling each (thetis, ueady double what was at that time the price of good
ash hoppoles)'; that 5 acres would thus, in 5 years, roduce 52914 and thet
each stump, tet aher the pole was cut down, wo d send up 2or 3 poles
ior tha next crop; which, being cut down in their turn, attha end of
another 5 years, would, of course, roduce two or three timanthe above
euna ”l (p ³82.); 'that locust apori is '⁶ abpplutely indestructiblc by the
att etinheim} ,tilii diffiditur} sili
Alter this, it will not be wondered at that Cobbett siould call the locust '‘ the
⁸ tree of tress,'’ and that he should eulogiae it iu the following passage, which
is so characteristic of theman, and so wellexemplilies the kind of quachery in
which he dealt, that we uota it enhret-“ Thetime will corne,” he οιοοηοο,
·“anditwill not be veryiistant, when the locust treewill be more common in
