1n ohnsequence ol the small quantity of terebinth produced by the trees in
Scio,a correspondent ol Du Harnel'a suggests the idea of grafting the P. vera,
or edible-fmibbeariug species, on the upper parts of trees ol P. terebinthus,
in order to render thern more profitable. He states that he baa seen this done

much resin as the ungralted plants ol the same species. In Britihh gardens,
the tree is not very common: the largest specimen that we know ol' it

22 st. high, that flowers every year, and· roducea sruit, which, though not fecun-
dated, attains the size ol small peas. is species ia generally considered as
the hardiest os the genus, end, with P. vera, may be planted in worm sheltered
aimations in the open border.
