ornamental shrub, not only in open situations, but, on a large scale, in woods,
to servem undergrowth, aud as a shelter for ganne. Professor Heuslow, in a
communication to the Magnae of Natural History, vol. ix. p. 476„ mentions
that he had seen some crystals of a substance resembling su candy, which
were found in the decayrng flowers of the lt. ponticum. he ayrup, which

Propagation All the rhododendrons may be propagated by cuttings ol the
young shoota, taken off in agrowin state, when their lower ends have begun
to ripen, and planted in pure saud, and covered with ιι bcllglasst but, in
ξ neral, thia mode isonly worth adopting in the case ol new aud rare sorta.

Calcare. Alter seedling planta have been a ear in pota, or in the seed-bed,
they are transplanted into nursery lines, an removed every year, or every
second year, and placed at greater distances, till they have attained thasiae
at which it is considered desirable to sell them, or to plant them where they
are finally to remain. At whatever age or siae they are removed from the
nurser ‚ they require, in common with all hair-rootcd planta, to heve a small
ball oi soil attachedto their roots, and to have these carehrlly protected
srorn drought by mats. lu consequence σι’ almost all the rhododendrons ,
and aaaleas being removable with balla, they may be transplanted at any
ιιιιοιι oi the year, though the autumn and spring are tbe periodq generally
made choica of. In consequence, also, os pest soil readrly ndherrng to the
librila of this genus, and, indeed, of all the Erichceae, it becomes less necea
to grew them in pots for the convenience of removal, than is the case wit
most other rare and valuable trees and shruba: for example, the Maguolidceoe.
In some ci the English nur-series, plante olllhododendron ponticum are trained
with single stema, ιο the height of tlt. or bh.. before they are suffered to
branch elit and, so treated, they make very handsome small trees.
