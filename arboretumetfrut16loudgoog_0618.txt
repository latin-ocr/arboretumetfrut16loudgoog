i'or t 'a reason, we recommend gardeners, when they are forming a scheme

during the principal summer months, by drawing a plan for each of these
months, and colouring the beda in each with the colours of the llowers
of those planta which are intended to be simultaneously iii bloom. Such
coloured plana being shown ιο tbe employers (aud more especially ιο the

lay before hia employers, once iii every year, twelve copies of the plan of his
flower-garden (for which purpose it might be lithograpbed), and these copies
being coloured b the la y of the family eeabl to her teste, or ideas of

species eiiceeding est. iii height, the malleat-growing kinds being laced in the
centra of the bed. Each of the other beds is to be filled with ieatbs which
never excecd eft. in height; every bed being liniited to heaths which come
into flower in the sanic mouth.. In fig 888.,onc half of the beda are nuin-
