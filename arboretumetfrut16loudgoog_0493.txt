¹· The Red Clangrogne, or Ironmouger, has the branches 11111 and fasti-
giate, and will form a handsome bush, 611. or 111. high.
Horrenmn’r Green Goge is a most vigorousgrowing plant, with aspread-
ing head, and will form a buslr 10 st. high.
Tire Red Rore is a vigorous-growing bush, with 1 11111011 head, hut

Description, Geo nphy, 11. The gooseberry, in a wild state, is a low
1111111, varying 11111 1n habit and magnitude, according to the soil and si·
11111011 in whrch it is found. Villara, in his 1111011111 Planter da Dra·
pleri, mentions that the gooseberry is common every where in that country;
that in hedges 11 grows to the height 01511. or 6 st, with large villous leaves ς
but that on mountains it is seldom found 10 high as 211, and with ver
rougb branches, wholly covered with yellowish strlf prickles. ln Englanri,
the gooseberry is found on old walls, in woods, and in hedges ς and, in Scot-
land‚ occasionally in the neighbourhood of villages ς and, though undoubtedly
naturalised in both countries, ir appears to us very doubtfu whether it is

aboriginal in either. It is, however, truly wild in Franoe, Germany‚ and
Switzerland, more particularly in the Valais and in Piedrnont, where it is

called griselle‚ and where rt rs found in copae-woods, producing a small,
green, bairy fruit. The common gooseberry, or a species nearly allied to it,
Royle observes, is found in the Himalayas‚ on mountains near the almost
inaccessible sources of the Ganges. There can be little doubt of its being
indigenous in North Amerina, where it is known by botanista under various
names. Among other localities, we may cite aa one the roclrs about the
Falla 01 Niagara, whence branches and ripe fruit have been sent to us. When
the bush is of any considerable siae, it is always sound in a tolerably dry
and loose free soil, and in a situation rather shady than otherwise; unless
we except the instances in which the seeds have been carried by birds to the
tops of walls, the surnmits of ruins, and the hollow trunks and partiali de·
cayed branches 01 011 trees. In the famous lime tree at Naustadt, in ur-
temberg, gooseberrles are grown 111 the hollow branchea, and the fruit sold
to strangers, as mentioned in detail in p. 372.

1111111111 ; and it 11 uncertain at what penod in modern times 11 began to be '
cultivated in gardens. The earliest notice of it ap ears to be in the Corn·
1111111111 11 Matthiolus, who states that it is 1 1111111111, which may be used
medicinally. Amon Britiah authors, it is first mentioned by Turner, in 1573,
and afterwards syharkinson and Gerard3 the last noticing it not only for
its medicinal properties‚ but for its use in coolrery. ln the 11111 edition 01 Da
Hamel, the gooseberry does not appear to have been cultivated about Ρ1111;
but he says rt was to be found in abundares in hedges and thickets, whence

The Dutch appear to have been the first who brought the fruit to any consi·
derable sine. In Les Agremenr de la Gonrpngne, ublished in 1750, “ les
groseilles '’ are said to be no where so good as in olland; and directions
are ‘ven for propagnting, training‚ and pruning the planta, so as to bring
the 't to a la esize, which vary very httle from the most approved prac-
tice ο1 11111111111111111111 growers of the resent day; and accordingly, in
