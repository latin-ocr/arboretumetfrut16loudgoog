muddy‚ unpleasing tint; and yet, sometimes, notwithstanding this early loss

“The beauty of tha roots of the ash,” Gilpin observes, ‘⁴ is of a pictu-
'dlqillf‘li‘ln litaret-{lt‘ll‘lltltlftltlltltttttttllr
certain lrnotty excrescences in the aab, called the brusca and mollusca, which,
when cut and poliched, are very beautiful. He particularly mentions a dinin -
table made of tbe latter, which represents the exact figure of a lisb. Wit
segurd to tha exact ligure of animala and other objecta, which we meet with
both in stone and wood, Ι cannot say 1 should velue them much aa objecta of
beauty. They may be whimsical and curious; but, iu my opinion, the roots
and veins of wood and stone are much more beautiful when tbey are
wreathed in different fantastic forms, than when they seem to aim at any
exact ligures. ln the former case, they leave the imagination at liberty to
play among them, which is always a pleasiug exercise to it ς in the latter, they
are, at best, awkward and unnatural likenesses, which osten disgust the pic·
turesque eye, and always please it less than following its own fancy, and
picking out resemblances of its own.'’ (For. &emp 38.)

The roeeatled Fascio in ste Aah Thea is likewise o the picturesque kind, and
consiste of u sort ol excrescente, which is sometimes found on aleading branch,
and is called by this nante. ‘⁸ The fasciated branch is twisted and curled into a
very beautiful form; which form it probably takes, as Dr. Plot supposes, from
too quick anascent of the sap (see ilat. Has. ο] Oss„ cb. vi. pez) ς or,asother
naturalista imagine, from t e punctura of some insect in the tendet· twig,
which diverts the sap from its usual channel, and makes the branch menstruus.
The wreatbed fascia is sometimes found in other wood, in the willow particu-
larly, and in the trossy, but most commonly itis an excrescente of the aab.
Ibave a fasciated branch of ash, found in the woods of Beaulieu, in the New
Furem, which is most elegantly twisted in the form of a crosier; and 1 have
scen a bolly, also, twiated like a ram’s horn. We have this appearance sorne-
times in asparagus? (Id, p. 39.)

Tle Spray ostie Aah (fig. told.) “ is very different from that of the oali, the
elm, or the beecb. Ast eboughs of the ash are leae complex than those
of the oali, so is ita apra . Instead of tha thick intermiugled busbiness
which the spray of the o exhibita, that of the ash is much more simple,
running in a kind of irregular parallels. The main stem holds its course,
forming at the same time a beautiful sweept but the spray does not
divide, like that of the calc, from the extremrty of the last year's shoot,
but springs from the sides of it. Two shoots spnng outo posite each other ς
and each pair in a contrary direction. Rarely, however, do both the shoota
of either side come to maturity: one of them is commonly lost as the
tree increaaes, or, at least, makes no appearance in comparison with the
