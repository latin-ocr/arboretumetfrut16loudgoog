salute the opple trees with much ceremony,in ordertomake thembear well the
next season. This salutation consiste in throwing some of tlte cider about
the roots of the trec, placing bits of the toast on the branches3 and then,
forming themselves into a ring, they, lilre the barda of old, set up their voices,
and sing a song, which may be found in Brand's Populor Antiquities.” (Mn.

there stated, that the farmer and his men, after making their oblation of elder,
encircle one of the best bearing trees in the orchard, and repeat three times
the song, which is as follows z -

“ Here’s to thee, old epple tm.

'rtis is sometimes done on the Twelfth Ni ht Ere, os well ss on Christmas
Eve; sud, at the former-mentioned festival, when the song is finishcrl, the
whole party return to the house, the doors of which they find bolted against
them b the semeles, who were left at home, and who refhse to open the
door tillsome one of the party “has gnessed what is on the cpit, which is e·

-T e farmer and his workmen go out into the orchard, after supper, on the
eve of 'l'welfth Night, with a large millt- n full of cider, haring roasted
sp les pressed into it. “ 0ut of thia, eachaperaon in company takes what is

ed ‘a clsyen cup,' that is, an earthcn cup full of liquam and, standing
under each of the most fruitful of the epple trees, and passing lsy those that
are not good hearers, he addresses it in the following words :—

And then, drinking of the contenta, he throws the rest, with the frag-
ments of the roastc apples, at the tree. At each cup the com ysetnp a
shout.” ln Henefords re, Brand tells us that, “at the roae of erening,
on the vigil of the Twelfth Day, the far-mers, with their nenda and servants,
meet together, and aboutd o’cloclr wallr out to a field where wheat is growing.
On the highest part of the ground, 12 small lires, and one large one, are
