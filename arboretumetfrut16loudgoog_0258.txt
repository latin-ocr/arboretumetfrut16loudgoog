Propngntion ond Csdtnre. The raspberry requires s vegetabit soil, rather
moist, solt, and not very deep; because most of the roots, like those of sll
other plante that throw up numerous suelters, keep near the surfaee3 end
the situation should be shaded, rather than fully exposed to the meridien sun.
In a wild state, itis slmost always found more or less shnded by trees,but not
under their drip ; end in noodr, the situation of which is rather low and meist,
thsnhillyandrockyordry. 'l'he root belongs to that description which beslled
mvellingt that is, the suckers extend themselves all round the eentrsl plant,
so ss every year to come up in fresh soil. Hence, ss hliller observes, a rasp-
berry plantation requires to be renewed every five or six years. The mp-
berry, for this reason, has been considered as a good example of the doctrine
of the menedon of plante, first broached hy Bragmahsy afterwards explained
in detail by De Candolle, in the Phyriologie Ve'gclole‚ vol. i. p. tls, and sub·
sequently elucidated, by various experiments, hy M. Maesue. (See Sappl.
Encye. Agri, p. 1301.) This doctrine, which, in Britain, seems to have been
first hinted at by Mr. Sheriff of Mangos Wells, and ΜΓ. Towers, the author
of the Dontcrh'c Gardcrrer'r Maneat, is supposed to account scientilieally for
the effect of nsked fallows on soils; but asuffieient number of experiments
have not yet been made, to establish the doctrine on asecure foundation.
(See Gar-d. Mag, xii. p. 299. ; and Phil. Mag, 3dser, vol. viii.) Itis certain,
however, thet the raspberry, in s wild state, is continual} ehenging its situa-
tion ; and, in s state of culture, that it re uires to be frequently taken up,
and replanted in fresh soil. The seeds of the ras berry sre sard to retain
the vitel principle for n very long peripd3 and a plant, now (1836) in the
Horticultursl bociety’s garden, was rsrsed from seeds found in a barrow,
or tumulus, in Wiltshire, opened in 18353 which, unless we can suppose the
seeds to have been conve ed into the interior of the tumulus by insects
or vermis, must have lain tiene many centurias.
