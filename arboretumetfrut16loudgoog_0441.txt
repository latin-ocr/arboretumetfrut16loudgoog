Βεισιίριὶοιι. Α trec, in foliage and general ap ce, closely resembling
the mountain ashg but attaining a lsrger aize, sn bearing much lsrger fruit,
of a greenish brown colour when ripe ln France this tres attains the height
osso ft. or 00 ft: it requires two centuries before it reaches its full sise3 and
lives to aegrest sn nge, that snrne specirnens of it are believed to be upwards
of 1000 years old. t grows with an erect trunlr, which terminares-in a lar e
pyramidal head. The burk of the trunlr ia smoorh and grey, like that of e
mountain ssh, in young trees3 and that of the amaller branches is slightly
reddish3 but the berk of the trunlr, in old trees, is rougb, scsly, and full of
eracks, snd its colour ia a dut brown. This tres is readily known from the
mouuuin ssh, in winter, by its buds, which are smooth aud green, instead of
being dowuy aud blacky in the beginning of summer, by rta lesflets being
broaden dowuy above, and also beneath; and, iu autumn, by its pesr or apple
ahsped fruit, which is four or live times the aize of that of P. aucupiria, snd
of a dull grsenish brown colour. lt is said to be 30 years before it cornea
into a bearingstste when itis raised irorn the seed, but, whn scions from
fruihhesring trees are grafted on seedling planta, or on the mountain ssh,
they conre into bearing in n few years, aa nr thecuae of other fruit trees.

Geography, scembs. The true service is not found in abundance in
any part of the world. There are, perhaps, more trees of it in the middle
region of France, and the Alps of Italy, than in all other countriss put
together ς but it is also found iu the south of Germany, in some parta of
the north of Africa, and in Western Asia. lt was formerly said to be s native
