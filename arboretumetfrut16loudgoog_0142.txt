1001. The next race 01 children but one, that is to say, those who will be
born 60 years hence, will think that locust trees have always been the most
numerous trees in England; aud some carious writer 01 0 century 01 1110
hencewill tell his readers that, wonderful as it may seem, ‘the locust was
hardly known in Eugland until about the year 1823, when the uation was
introduced to 0 knowledge 01 11 by William Cobbett.' What he will say 01
rne besides, 1 do not know; but l lrnow that he will say this 01 me.
lenter upon this account, therefore, lrnowing that Iam wrrting 101 0011-
turies and centuries to corne.'' (11111, d 351.) The absurdity 01 the above
passage rendere it almost unworthy 01 comment; hut we may remark
that, even supposing all that Cobbett says in it 01 the application 01 the
locust were true, the uses which he has enumerated do not amount toa
hundredth part 01 those 10 which timber is ap lied in this country. Hence,
were his predictions to be verified, and. were 110 locust to become more pre-
valent than 11100011, 110 should 11011 110 wood a miserable substitute, iu the
construction 01 ships and houses, 101 that 01 0111 ordinary timber trees.
Every experienced planter or timber owner, both in Europe and America,
has felt this; and this is the true reason why the tree never has been, and
never will be, extensively planted. '
There can be no doubt as to the durability 01 lull-grown or matured locust
wood, and 01 110 11111000 101 posta, treuails, &c.; but there is no evidence,
either in Mr. Cobbett's Woodlanda, 01 111 all that was printed in lllr. Withers's
11001110, when he kindly lent us 1110 proof sheets, rn April, 1836, that the
locust is suitable 101 hop· oles, either in pointos rapid growth, or of durability.
In order 10 procure the lirtest information on this subject, 1νο wrote 10 three ,
individuale iu the centre of hop couutries, and to the Earl 01 Radnor, Robert
Rich, Esq., Philip demes case, Esq., and some others, whose letters to Mc.
Withers in favour 01 the locust are printed iu his boolr. The general result
Ι01 the whole is, that the locust has scarcely been tried 101 hop-poles; aud
that, where it has been put 10 this or analogous uses, it has failed. On Lord
denor’s estete, at Coleshill, his bailiff, the Daniel Palmer so 011011 mentioued
by Oobhett, says, “ the acaciae were tried 11010101 espslier 0101000011 soon
decayed; none have been applied lor poles or gata posts. Those planted on
light land soon got stunted, but 001110 01 those rn deep land grew well. Iam
