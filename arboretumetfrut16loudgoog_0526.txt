The iryis considered symbolical of friendsbip, ¹from the closeness of itr
adherence to the tree on which it hes once lixed itself. ‘⁸ Nothing,” ceys St.
Pienc, in his medes ns Naum, ‘¹ can seperate it from the tres which it has
once embraced: it clothes it with its own leaves in that inclemeut resson
when its derk boughs ere covered with boarfrost. The faithfrd companion of
its destiny, it falls when tbe tree is cut down: death iteelf does not relax its
gresp; audit continues ιο adorn with ite verdure tlte dry trunk that once sup-
ported it.” The constane of the iry hes rendered it e favourite device for
seule; some of the best ol which are,a sprig of iry, with the-mette, ‘⁸ ldie
where I attach tnyself;” end a fallen trec, still covered with iry, with the
words, ‘¹ Even ruin cannot separate us.” [vy is the badgeof theclan Gordon.

evit, Sdcation, Propagatton, ec. We have already oberved that thei ,to
attein a large aiae, requires a good soil; and, also, that it grows natural y in
the rhode, eud in e northern rather thehina southern exposure. Smoke,
there can be no doubt,is injurious to the iry; but still it endures it better then
nioat evergreens, particularly when it ie kept moist at the root. lry is propa-
geted by cuttings, planted, in autumn, in a sendy soil, and ashady border3 but
these mitet be well rooted before they are put out in the situation where they
are finally ιο remain, or disa poiutmeut to the planter will ensue. It isrery
natural to suppose, thet, wiell e plant rooting so readily es the iry, it would be
quite sufficient to put in ecutting where eplant was wanted, but,nerertbelesa,
it ie efact, that, unless the soil be kept ιιι e uuiform stete of molsture, and
sheded, like most other erergreeus, itwill not root readily. The largest plents
of ivy which we heve heard of in En land erest Brockley Hall, ιιι Somet-
setsbrre attached ιο old trees: oue olgtbese plante has the stem 103in, end
tlte other 11· in. in diameter, at rh. from the ground. In the town of
Mo eth, in 'Nonhumberland the front of e cottage -is covered with iry,
whic proceeds from a single stem, that comes out of s crerice in the rough
stone wall by the cottege, at ebout a foot from the ground. The stem where
it comes out is about diu. in diameter, but it gradually increeses till at the
height of cst. itis θξίιι. in diameter; and at the height of 9 ft, at the point
from which the branches proceed‚ it is oo less that 19 in. in diameter!
