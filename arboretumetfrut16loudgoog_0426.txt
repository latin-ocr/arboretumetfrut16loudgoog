The little gray Mon (Yponomedta pedella Lat, nea padella L.) makes
grem havock on hedges of the common hawthorn, on an le trees, end on many
other trees end ebrubs. S ing cf this insect, hir. in observes, ‘¹ Wher-
ever the caterpillare seat t emaelves, they appear to be congregated in vest
numbers: every sprey is covered. The leaves vanish before them; so that by

following points ιο the insect’s economy: the tirne and place in which the
mother moth deposita her egge ς the time at which the catemillare are batched
from the eggs; and their course of leading, from the time of being hatched,
to the time at which the effecte of their ravages command our observetion
of thern. These points have been elucidated by the investigatione of the
lete hir. E. W. Lewis, and by his brother, Mr. R. Η. Lewis. From a
communication on this subject by the latter gentleman, published in the
Thomactione (μ’ tle Entomclogical Society qs Lendcn, we ote the following
particulare :··‘ The mother moth deposita her egge in t epreceding year,
generally on the aninll twigs, and chiefly on their under surface, in acirculer
patch about lh line in diameter, which she covers over with a strong gluten,
at first of a pale yellow, but which is afterwards, by the action of the atmo-
sphere and rain, changed to a darlr hrown‚ very closely resembling the
berk of the trae, and is then very difficult ιο be distinguished fremit. The
egge hatch early in the autumn (the exact time Ι did not escmtain: 1 found
them hatched in the beginning of October), end the lervae remain in confine-
ment during the whole winter, under the covering which is formed by the
gluten and agg-chelle. lf we now raise up one of these excrescentes, we
shell findit hollow inside, end containing two dozen or more larvae, of a nale
yellow colouv, with the head and a corneous plate on the first segmcnt black,
and about half or two thirds cf a line long. In these recepte-cles they in·

but whether, or how, they derive nourishtnent from it,1nm at a lons to

which they nilne into the leaves, eeting the perenchyma [cellular tissue] only,
and leaving the epidermis untouched.

atmosphere, and to devour the epidermie of the leaves, they make their way
