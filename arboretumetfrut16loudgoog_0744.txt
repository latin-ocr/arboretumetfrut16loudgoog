The most proper station for the ash, according to Nicol, is the forest or the
grove. Marshall recommends theash ιο be planted alternately with the oalr;
because, aa the aab drawa ιιι noun'ahment hom the suriaco, and the oalt hom

can be no doubt whatever that the ash ought to be planted either along with
