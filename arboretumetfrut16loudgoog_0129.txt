Demean. Deciduous trees, natives of North America, where one of the
speeies is highly valued lor its timber. In Europe, all the spechs are much
rized both lor their use and beauty‘. They are readil propagsted by seeds,
erge truncheons ol the stem and branches, cuttings odthe roots, or by guh-
ing3 and they will grow in any soil that ia not too wet. Their roota are
creeping, and their branches very brittle: they grow repidly, but are not
pmffslly of long duration. Their rapid growth is a property that they
ave iu common with all trees and plaute the principnl roots os which extend
themselves close under the surface; because there the soil is always richeet:
but the same cause that produces this rapidity at hiat, occasions the tree to
grew slowly nsterwsrds, unless the roots are allowed ample space on every
side3 since, aa they never penetrate deep, they soon exhaust allthe soil within
their resch. For this reason, also, suc trees are objectionable se hedgerow
trees, or aa scattered groups in areble lands3 their roots proring a serious irn-

hybrida and R. intermedia, might also have been considered as varieties,
but we have preferred keeping thern spert.
