are kept in the pod, and huried ιο a great depth in dry aoil, they will remain
good for ⁵ or 6 years, or perhaps longer. As seed-bearing trees aeldom produce
two abundant crops in succession, a reserva ahhuld he kept from one year

thoae which are obtained srom America. Accordin to Miller, editor of the
Journal der Fortes, M. Roland, sen, adistinguished irench agriculturiet, finds
that American seed germinates best when aown late in the year. (Wthcrr’r
theotho, p. 280.) Cohhett recommends ateeping the secde before thep are
eown, by pouring boiling water on them, and strrring them about in it or an
honr or more, till they swell. Probably, it may be worth while to stee the
seeds, in some casea in cold or tepid water, especially if the ceam sho d be

done with great caution3 and boihng thern aa Oohbett saye (h 383.) dege
