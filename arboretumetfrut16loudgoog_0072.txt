berries, afford a blaelt inlr-like tinctura. 'l'he berries are eaten by children
with impunity, but they are very sour: they are red, and are made use of
ior dyerng that same colour.” (Martya’s Miller.) Professor Rogare, in
„Sillima's Journal, vol. xxvii. .294., observes that the berries contain a
large portion of the malie aci ,and are used aa a substitute lor lemons in
vuinus preparatione of domestic economy and medicine: the leaves are used

in tanning. ln British gardana, this sort has been cultivated since 1726. A ·

lant in the gardan of the London Horticultural Societ was, in 1834, oft.
dign after berng 10 years planted. The history and culture arethe same

as those of R. typhlna.

Thuoberg sffirrns that the very best Ja an varnidr is mede from this
des, which is the ahts vernixlol Lin. diat. Med, though not of Lintdg
Plana it grows tn abundance m manp parts of that country3 and is cul·
civated in several places, on account ο t e advantage derived from it. The
vamish, which oozes out of the tree onita being wounded, is procured
l'rom stema that are three years old, and is received into some proper
vessel. When first collected, it is osa whitish colour, and of the
consistence os cream; but grows thicker and black on being exposed
to the air. lt is eo transparent, that, when laid, pirre and unmixed,
upon boxes or intuitum, every vein of the wood may be clearly seen
through it. For the most part, a darlr ground is spread underneath it,
which musas it to reflect like a mirror; and lor this purpose recourae is
frequently had to the fine sludgp which ia collected in the trough under a
grindstone; or to gronam c arcoa13 occasionally, a red substance is
mixed with the varnish, and sometimes leaf gold ground very fine. This
varnish hardens very much, but will not endure any blows, craching and
liying almost like glass; though, at the same time, it can stand boiling
water without receiving any darnage. With this the Japanese varnish
over the posts os their doors and windowa, their drawers, chests, bores,
scimitars, fans, tea-cupa, soupdishes, their portable stools, and most
articles of household furniture which are made of wood. (Mart. Mali.)
