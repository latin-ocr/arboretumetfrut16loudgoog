concludes that, though the mdrisier existed in France, it had robsbly never
attracted the notice of the cultivated 11001000, as, even 11 they iisd discovmd
the tree, they would have set little value 00 its bitter,austera, and nearly juice·
less t‘ruit ς end that, when Lucullus brought either 0. vulgaris, or someimproved
variety ot' it, from the country near Cerasus, they considered the 1101100 new.
At all events, it does not appear to have been cultivated before the time 01
Lucullus, though al'terwards it made such rapid progress, that Pliny, in his
Nataral History, tells us, ‘⁶ ln 26 years aller Lucullus lanted the cherry
tree in Italy, other lands had cherries, eyes as far as ritain, beyond the
ocean.” lt is curious, that, in Pliny's enumeration 01 the sotts 01 cherry cul-
tivated ia his time (a. n. 70), 1ιο mentions 0. duracina, and 0. 1011100, both
ναι-101100 01 C. sylvestris. The former, he says, are much esteemed; and ‘¹ the

As Pliny wrote above 100 years aller the tima 01 Lucullus, it is imponente
now to ascertahr whether all the cherries he mentions were introduced by
that general, or originated by culture in Ital , &a At all events, the tree

In Britain, e testimony 01 most authors confirma the statement 01 Pliny,
that the tree, or, at least, the cultivated cherry, was introduced by the Romanae
and tradition says that the first cherry orchards were lanted in Kent; s
circumstance which seems confirmed by the celebrity which has been long
maintained hy that county 1οι its cherries. Some writers essert that the
cherries introduced by the Romans were lost during the period that the
count was under the dominion 01 the Saxons, till they were reintroduced
by Ric ard Harris, gardener to Henry V111, who brought them from Flan-
ders, and planted them at Sittingbourne, in Kent. The incorrsetness 01 this
story is, however, proved by the fact that Lydgate, who wrote in 1415 (during
the reign 01 IIenry V.), speahs of cherries being exposed for sale in the Lon·
don market (lerard, in his Herbnl, published in 1597,11ςοιο0 s double and
semidouble variety 01 cherry3 and, 01 the fruit-bearing ltinds, says that there
were numerous varieties. Among others, he particularly mentions the blnck
wild cherry, the fruit 01 which was unwholesome, and hsd “an harah and
unpleasant taste;” and “the Flenders, οι Kentish, cherries,” 01 which he
says, that,vvhen they arethoroughly ‘ ,they“haveabetterjmcabutwatery,

callsaFrench cherry. In the snrvey and valuation, made in losannensem
and mansion belonging to Henrietta Maria, Quaen 01 Charles L, at Wint-
hledon, in Surrey, previously to its sale duringthe Commonwealth, it appears
that there were upwards 01 200 cherry trees in the gardens. (Archoeologm,
