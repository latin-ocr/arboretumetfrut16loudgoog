in 1829, and now to be met with

nearly in all good collectione. The

ahining leaves and large crimem glit-

tering blossorns (resembling those of the luchsia) oi this species render
it a most desirable acquisition to tlre flower-garden and shrubbery. The
leaves, innsavourable situations, are frequently retained during great part
os the wrater; anthat rt may almost be considered as an ever een.
lt will grow by cuttings ol the old or young wood‚ but not so r ily as
most other speciem and, therefore, it ia generally propagated by pegging
down the shoota quite llat‚an‹l coveriug thern with an inoh of soil, as recom-
mended sor the propagation of the common plum lor atocks. (p. 690.) When
plante are wanted expeditiously, this ought to be done in a pit, or bed of
earth covered with a frenae, to which heat can be applied b lrnings. Planta
os dria species do not grow so rapidly aa most others ο the gooaeberry
sections3 and their branches arch over and droop in auch a manner, as
not to display the flowera to advantage, unless the branchea are raised at
least to the level of the eye. For this reason, the plant ought either to
be grown on elevated rockwork, or trained to an espalier or wall; and, in
the latter case, aller it has attaineda certain height, the lateral shoote may
be allowed to protrude from the espalier or wall, when they will display
theirlllowers to very great advantage. Judging from the planta in the
Horticultural Socret ’s Garden, we should not think thatt is speeies, aa
a detached buah‚ will attain a greater height than att. or att. Price os
