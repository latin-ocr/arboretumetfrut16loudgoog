01 any other species of the genus. The growth of the common laurel is rapid
for an evergreen, being at the rate of from lli. to 3st. a year; butas the
shoots extend in length, they do not increase pro ortionately in thickness, and

though gigantic in siae, still retain the character 01 prostrate shrubs. ln
England it flowers in April and May, and ripens its fruit in October. Not·¹

Gffigmply, History, &a The common lsurel is found wild in woody and
subalpina regions in Caucasus, on the mountains of Persia, and in the Crimea,
where, according to Pallas, it forms a large evergreen sbmb, llowering in
April. It was first received by Clusius, at the beginning of the year 1576,
hom David Ungnad (then ambassador from the Emperor 01 Germsny ιο Con·
munnople with someother rare trees and thrubs3 which all perished by the
severity the winter, and the carelessness of those who bro ht them,
except this piant and a horsechestnut lt was sent hythe name o Trdbison
etsrmdsi, or the date, or plum, of Trebisond, a city of Asia Minor, on the
Black Sea. Clusius relatas that the plant of laurei was almost dead when
it arrived3 but he put it into astove exactly as it came, in the same tub, and
with the same earth. ln the April following he took it out,cut off all the
dead and witbered branches, and set it in a shady place. In the aummn it
began topush from the roott he then removed the living part into another
tub,and took eat care 01 ἱι. When it was advanced in growth, helaid
down the brarrc es, which took root, and he distributed the plante which he
thus raised among his friends and men 01 eminence. Such was the arigim
in Europe, of a shrub now become so common every where. Clusius’s plant
died without tlowcrin ς but another, which he gave to Aicholm, ilowered in
lday, 15s33 and aisa years afterwards it flowered with Jouchim Came·
rarius, at Nuremberg. Parkinson, in his Paradae, published in 1629, says
be bad a plant of the hay cherry, as he calls it, by the friendly gili of Master
James Cole, a merchant of London, then lately deceased ς a great lover of all
raritiea who hedit growing with him at his country-house in Highgate, where
it had llowmed divers times, and borne ripe fruit also. He describes Master
Gole’s “aa a fair tree,'’ which he defended from the bitterness of the westher
by castirg ablanket over the top thereof every year, thereby the better to pre-
serve it. ln the hrst edition 01 Gerard’s Herbcl, published in 1597, the laurel is
not mentioned; but in the appendix to Johnson's enlarged edition, published
in 1633, it is said that the cherry bay “ isnow got into man of our choice Eng-
lish gardens, where it is well respected for the beauty odthe leuues, and their
lasting, or continuall, greennesse.” Evelyn, in the lst edition of his Sylva,
ubliahed in teat, says that “this rare tree was first brought from civita

sechia, in 1614, by the Countess of Arundel, wife to that illustribus patron
01 arts and antiquities,'l'hon1as Earl 01 Arundel and Surrey,'' to whom this
countryis indebtedfor the possession 01 ι1ιο Arundelian marbles. Evelyn
‘⁸ a noble lord;’' thinki it “more likely that it came from some colder
clbue.’' By the Hctmy vidite Arandel Fanaly, it appears that the Corintess 01
Arundel set out ιο Italy 101614, 1οι the purpose 01 accompanylng her two
sons ιο E land; sod,as there are an immense number of ver old latrrels at
Wardour sstle, the present seat 01 the family, it is probabis thartha tra-
ditionis correct; though the plant may also have been introduced by some
otber person. Ray, in 1666, relatas that it was first brought from Tre·
msoud to Constantinople ; thence to Italy, France, Germsny, and ιο Englsnd,
where it was very common in gardens and shrubberiest that it increased,
llowered, and fruited very well; was very patientes cold, and braved our
wintere, even in exposed situations ς “that ιι rocta easily, grows qulck, and
in a short time becomes a tree 01 tolerable size; bnt that it is not fitted
for topiary work, on account 01 its thick and woody branches,'’ &c (Hict,
