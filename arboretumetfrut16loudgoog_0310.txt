mellowed hythe frost: this was doneby removing the seeds and chaffybristles

which line the inside of the hip, and afterwards beating the pulpy matter up in

amortar with sugar. The mos-sy protuberance frequently seen on the wild

rose and the aweet brisr was also formerly used in medicine; but it is now

For cudnory aad consectimsery Paspores, rose-water is in much demand.
Very good tarta are also made, on the Continent, of the conserve of the hips,
as well aa of the conserve of the petals; end rose-buda are preserved isanger,
and pickled in vinegar. The epple-bearing roae (Rosa villdsa pomifera)
produces the largest fruit of all, and is'the best ad ted for reserviug; but
R. systyla and R. arvensis are said by Mr. Joseph oods dbia. mam.) to
produce fruit, which, though of a smeller size, is of a higher flavour thau that
of any other species. (Hert. Soc. Col. cy* aneo, edit. 1826, p. 195.) The
employment of the rose in the manufacture of liqueurs has been already
mentioned. The green leaves of the sweet brier are sometimes, on the
Continent, steeped in spirits of wine, to communicatem it afragrance3 and
they are commonly used, in Englaud, to put into cowslip wine, to give ita
flavour. Tea has been also mede of these leaves; and those of all the sorts,
as well as the young tender shoots, are readily eatan by cattle, horses, and
sheep. The points of the luxuriant shoots of sweet brier, deprived of their
barli and leaves, and cut into short lengths, are sometimes candied lilre the
blanched leaf-stallis of angelica and liuocchio.

The Wood ofthe Rose is very hard and compect, and of a fine grain ; aud, if
it could he procured of sufficient dimensions, rt might serve as a substitute sor
box, in making mathematical instrumenta.

Hedges are formed both of the wild and of the cultivated rose3 but they
are not well adapted for the purposes of protectior and enclosure, from their

rembling habit of growth, the large space they occupy when unpruned‚ aud ·

their liability to become nahed below when cut in on both sides, so aa to

situations, forms a very haudsome evergreen hedge, llowering nearly all the

y Usdergrowthsoslloser. Many of the climbing and trailing sorte, and par-
ticularly the evergreen varieties of these, are well adopted, as Mr. Rivers has
observed (ρ.781.),1οτ undergrowths in open woods; but, iu this case, the
timber trees should not be so close as to touch each other with their branches,
and, consequently, to exclude the direct rays of the sun from the rosea.
These, also, should be allowed, in some places, to climh to the tops of the
highest trees, where they will llower profusely, and, in a few years, hang
down ς occasionally forming festoons from one tree to another in a nran-
ner singularly beautiful and picturesque. The different varieties os Rhea
arvensis, especially the Ayrshrre and evergreen roses, are particularly well
adapted for this purpose. We have seen fine examples of the effect os
climbin roses, roduced in some neglected parts of the woods at Eastwell
Parlr, lgains Hill, Clarerpont, and more articularlyuat Pepperharrow. At
Spring (drove, the late Str Joseph Banhslrad a Srhenan variety of the Rosa
arvensis, which produced a singularly rich and beautiful effect on a gronp of
tall trees near the house. Mr. Bechl'ord of Fonthill formed, about less.
in his woods, several acres of undergrowths of rosea of the very choicest
kinds: and the effect was extraordinary (though it could not be called ap ro-
priate), while care was bestowed upon them; but, no sooner was the place
quitted by Mr. Beckford‚ in 1826, and the plantation neglected, thau they
began to be cholred up by brembles, and other planta sown by the birds, and
to die off, till, when we visited the scene in 1833, we could not observa a
single rose remaining. (See Gard. Mag, vol. xi. p. 441.)
