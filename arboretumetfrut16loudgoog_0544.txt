through the body of ahird3 and, st his suggestion, Mc. Doody, an apothecary
oi hondom inserted a seed of the mistletoe into the barli ol a white poplar
trec, which grew in his garden, with complete success. This, Professor
Martin observes, hes been since donc by many misens, both by ruhbing the
herries on the smooth harh oi various traca, and by insertino them in a cleti,
or in a small hole hored on urpose, which was the ιιιοάε ado tedbyDoody.
Mc. Baxter of the Oxford fictamc Garden, in the spring 1833, ruhhed
nine miatlstoe seeds on the smooth harlr ol un apple trec, all of which germi-
nated: two produced only one redicle each, six produced two radicles each,
audone produced three ; hom which it follows, that two radicles ure more

The celebrated Du Hamel, arguing that the seeds of the mistletoe, like the
secde of other planta, would germinate anywhere, provided thep had a suitable
degpee of humidity, made them sprout not only on the barlm ο different kinds
oi 'ring uses, but on dead branchea, on hriclrs, tiles, stenes, the ground, &c
But, though they germinated in such situations, they did not lire any time,

It ia remarhed hy Du Hamil, that, when the form os the seedis oval,
generally one radicle only is protruded 3 but, when it is triangular or irrqulsr,
2, 3, or more, appear. It is srngrlm, that, while the radicis o almost all other
plents descends, this is not the case with thc mistletoc; the po root oi
which at first rises up, end then hends over till it reaches theb yos the
arhstsnce to which the secd has been attached, aa at k and l,fig. 772. Haring ⁶
