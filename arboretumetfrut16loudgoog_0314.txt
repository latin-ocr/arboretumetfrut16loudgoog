Situation ia Gordos Sceney. In country residencea, rosea are generally dis·
tributed in the margins ol shrubberies along with other flowerin shrubs: bnt,
considering the culture they require, it is impossible they cau t 've in such a
situation ; and, even if they did darive, the laind of heaut which they would
produce would be os a character so different from that o agenna] shrnbbery,
aa, according to the principles of a reasonable teste, to require their exclusion
from it. The only roses fit to be planted in a shrubbery arethe single kinds,
in their wild state. Rosea, and all other kinds of shrnbs or trees, that are
far removed from a state ol nature, and valued sor something produoed by
art, either in their flowers‚ lruit, berk, or leaves, should be grown in situ·
atione where the art which produced the artificial effect can be employed.
Hence all fruit-bearing trees and shrubs should be grown in orchards, iu
lritcben-gardens, or in some place by themselves, so as to admit os properly
cultivating the soil, and managiug the plauts. Rosea, and all double-flowering
shruhs, ought, in like manner, to be grown by themselves ς and the sarne prin·

been produced by a soil and situation os a peculiar nature: but that pe-

the rich soil, and favourahle situation. which produce large or double
llowera, or large and succulent fruit. Hence, to cultivate rosen properly,
they must be grown either in groups by themselves on a lawu, or iu a
llower·garden; or be connected intoa system of groups, or beds, in a
rosarium, or rose-garden.

Rotarinm, or Horetum. Where it is intended to plant a collection of
rosea, the best effect will be produced by devoting a group to each section3
such as one to mosa rosea, another to Noisettes,a third to Scotch rosea,

standards3 because the former are more conveniently loolred upon by the

be surroundod by a row of standands, which, in that case, should ave clear
stems, not less than 7st. high, through which the dwarf roses may be seen hy

The sines of the different groups in a rosaiium ought to be roportioned to
tlte number of varieties belonging to the section to be plantecl in each. For
these purposcs, the catalogue of Messrs. Rivers may be taken as a basis; and, as
it contains seventeen groups, exclusive ol the climhers, these may be represented
by seventeen circlcs of different diameters, or by serenteen squama, parallelo-
grauns, or clusters of irregular-sbaped figures, bearing the same proportion to
cachethes in regard to superficial contents. For euch kind ol rose to be

climbers, which, we think, have a better effect planted in au open arcade,
or in arow ol columns or obelisks, than crowded together in one group.
