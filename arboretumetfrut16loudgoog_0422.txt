fertile soil, and a sheltered situation. All the best epple erchards of Englend,
nod more especially those of the cider districts, it hasbeen obeerred by
logiats, follow the trnck of red rendstone, which strotches across the island
lirim Dorsetshire to Yorkshire. It hiis been observed in Irelsnd (see
Dublr‘n Soc. dhane), thet the best orcherds there are on limestorie gravelr
end, in Scotland, that the few orchnrds which are to be found in that country
ere on soils more or less celcereous. On the Continent, the two districts
most famous for ple trees are Normsndy end the Vale of Stuttgard3 aud
the subsoil, in bot countries, is well known to be limestone. ln short, every
kind of fruit, to be brought to perfectiori, requires s soil more or less ealce·
reone. In general, the observatione mede with reference to the pear tree
will apply in the esse ol the epple tree ; but the latter tree is more injuriosis
to h ¹ges, froin its low spreeding hesd3 and less favoureble to culinery

The Prop anon end Culture of the apple arethe seme ss those of the
peer tree. llild erube, like wild penis, ere gethered when they ere fully ripe,
sud either laid in e heep to rot, or possed between fluted rollers, and the
crushed fruit pressed for the juice, which is made into aii inferior kind of
cider or perry, and the seeds ure afterwards separated from the pomece br
maceration in water and siltin . This isthe mode prectised iii the Goldwortlr
Nursery, where-fruittree storia are raised on n more extensive scnle then
eriy where else in Britain. Where seedlings ere to be raised from cultivated
apples, pears, or other fniits, application is mede to the menufncturers of cider

eu to destro it the most simple modes appear to be, to hrush it off with a

mixture of salt end water, or with soot and salt, or alkali, or soap end water.
It will, however, be treated on more in detuil herealter. In the spring, the
esterpillars of different moths and sawflies ettsck the testes and linwers
