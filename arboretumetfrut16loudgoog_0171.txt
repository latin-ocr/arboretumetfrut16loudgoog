and we have not heard of any plant 01 this speeies having produced seeds in
England, except those mentioned by Miller, which, however, did not ripen ς
though we have seen trees at Alfort, near Paris, bearing their long crooked

but which, aller afew weeks, becomes extremely saur. The rsteo growtb
of this tree,for the iirst 1⁵ or 20 years,is generally about the average 01 a

Geogroplry. The sweet locust does not appear to have a ve extensive
range m the United States. It stans to belong more puscukarly to the
country west 01 the Alleghanies3 and it isscarcely found in an part of the
Atlantis states, unless it be in Limestone Valley, where the so' is generally
1101,ωά the 0110111100 001 exposed. In the fertile bottoms which are watered
by the rivers that empty themselves into the Mississippi, in the Illinois, and
still more in the southern parts of Kentucky and Tennessee, it is abundant
in fertile soils. 11 is generally found growing with Jriglans 01 ra and Chrys
squamosa, U‘lmus rirbm, Frkxinus uadrangulirta, Roblnia solid-Acarna,
Negtsdo frasinifblium, and Gymndcl us cenedensis. It is never found but
in good soil ς and its presence, Michaux observes, is aa infallible sign 01 the
greatest degree of fertrlity.

Hirtmy. The trae wss first cultivated in England, by Bish compton,
in vvou; and Miller informs us, that it produced pods in the Pasce (iarden
at Fulham, in the year 1728, that cameto their ull site3 but the seeds did

the normal form of the species. G. triacinthos was known iu Franco ku the
time 01 Du Hamel, who recommends itas an ornamental tree, but liable to
have its branches broken by the wind, more especially when the trae becomes
forked et the summit, and two branchos of equal size spread out on each
side. Iu Englandit was never recommended to be planted with any other

view than ss an ornaments] tree, till Cobbett became a nruseryman, and
suggested its use as a hedge plant. We do not know whether rt hal ever
been tried for this purpose m England; but Msnetti informs us (Gard. Mag„
rol xi. p. 643.) that it was used for hedges 10 Lombardy, but, lilre the robima,
when tried for the same purpose, it was soon given up. (See p. 620.)

and there only the wood isemployed for any useful purpose, though even
there it is but little esteemed. lt is used neither by the builder, nor the
wheelwright, but ia sometimes employed by farmers for fences, when they
cannot procura any more dursble kind of wood. Michaux says that the only
nseful urpose 101 which he thinks the tree is fit, is for making hedges3 but,
aa we kare already seen, it has not succeeded as ahedge lant 10 Europe.
