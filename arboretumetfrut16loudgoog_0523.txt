Many other propertres were attributed to thia plant by the ancients; but, lor
medicinal purposes, it appears at present to have fallen into disuse. The
great use oi the ivy, in modern times, isas an ornamental shrub. When the
eometrical style of gardening prevailed, it was much employed to train over
hames oi wire or latrice-work, formed by the vire-worher or joiner into
architectum] or sculptural shapes3 arbours, colonnadea, aad the ligures ol'
men and animala, being much more rapidly produced in thia manner, than by
the slow growth ol the yew or the box. At present, forms os this kind ere
no longer in oser but a plant ol inp trainedto a pole, and allowed to hranch
out at ua summit, forms a very stri ing object in small gardana. For covering
naked walls, rocks, or ruins, or communicating an evergreen rural appearance
to any part ol a town or suburban garden, no plant whatever equals the ivy a
though, in situations subject ιο the amoke o coal, it is apt to get naked
below, and requires ιο be partially cut down, or ιο have young plants planted at
the root of the old ones, to fill u the naked places, every four or live years.
A very singular effect produced by ivy occurs in the approach road ιο
Warwrclr Castle. The road is cut through a solid bed ol aandstone rocla
andita s'gles are, in some places, upwards of 12 st. high, if we recollect
rightly, and quite endicular and smooth. Ivy has been planted on the
up er suriaco of t e ground, which forms the summit of these perpendicular
ol' rock,in order, as it would peer, that it. might creep down and
cover their face. Instead of cresping, onerer, the ivy has grown over, with-
out attaching itself3 and its long, penduloua, matted shoots, which, in 1831,
aot only reached the approach road, hut actually trailed on it, waving' to and
lio with the wind, might be compared ιο aa immense sheet of water· falling
over a perpendiculer rock. Over challr cliffs, ivy sometimes hange down in

in varied tulis and festoons, which, in old chella-pits, as, for example, at
lngress Parlr, near Greenhithe, have an effect that is at once strikingly beau·
tiiul and pictoresque, In close shrubberies, in small gardens, or even in
large ones, where neither grass nor any other green plant will grow on the
soriace, the ivy forms a clothing ol perpetual verdure. Trained against es·
.paliera,latticsworlr, iron hurdlas, or wire frames, it forms, in a very short
time, most beautiful evergreen walls, οι· hedges, sor the shelter or separation of
flower-gardens. ln short, there is no evergreen ahrub capable os being plied
to so many important uses as the common ivy; and no garden (in a elmete
'where it will stand the open air), whether large or small, can dispensa with it.
About London, it is raised in immense quantities in pots, and trained to the
heightof lrom 6 a toret. on atalaes ; so that, at any seaaon of the year, a hedge
may be formed of it, or a naked space covered with it, at an incredibly short
notice. ln the streete of London, ahouse may be built from the foundations in
the cauma ol three or sour weeks; and, by placing pota of ivy in the balconies

ev n leaves as effectually as if it were an old building, in a secluded
ru situation. One valuable use to which the ivy may be applied in street
‚housea in towns is, to form external framings to the windon's instead ol ucho
traves. ln the interminable lines of nahed windowa in the monotonous brick
houaes built about 50 years ago, which sarm the majority ot' the London
streetsat the west end of the town, tha ivy affords a resource which any
