partin the winter seaaon. 1r there were sufficient room, the mode which
we should recommend as decidedly the best would be, to allot a circular
space ol d ground to every plant, according to its siae, enlarging the diameter
ol that circ eas the plant increased, aud grouping the circles along one or
both sides ol' a walk. The next beat plan rs, to have a circle devoted to each
genus andita species, of kinds os which there are few varieties; and to each
species and its varieties, where the varieties ol each species are numerous t or
to have a group to consist ol several plants lor each variety ot' the more showy
hinds oi azalea and rhododendrum and place the less showy kinds in groupa
containing two or three sorte each.

The design fig. 1002. incalculated for an ericacetum oi this description.
In it the space o a included by the wall is a perlectly level lawn; and itis also
persectly level from b, by c, to a. Beyond these points, the ground gradually
risen, and is planted solely with American trees. The gronps in which
ahrubs are represented are planted with evergreens ς and all the others with
decidnous shrubs. The groups also from c tod are devoted to American

shruba not belonging to the order Erichreoe, decidnous and evergreen; so ·

that this scene, taken as a whole, may be considered aa an American ar-
boretum and l'rrrticetum.

For displaying a choice collection of Ericticeoe to the greatest advantage,
the mosteffectual'mode is, tn dispose of them in lineal succession ; so as that

evergreens at regular distances3 as are the centrnl groups in which shrubs are
indicated. The other heda and circular grou s, which are shaded, are lor
decidnous shrubs, The general surlace is pertiictly level, and the surrounding
plantation consiste rolely oi the pine and lit· tribe, including the genera
cupressus, Thirja, andJuniperus. The lowest-growing species are placed
next the walk, and the taller ones behind in gradual succession, so tbat the
trees may rise one above another, and form a complete amphitheatre of
perpetual verdnre. If such an edcacetum were formed in a roclry country,
