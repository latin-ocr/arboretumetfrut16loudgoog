Ἰ C. Ra droctedrc Sen— This has very numerous flowers, and their
pedicels are attended by long bracteas. lt is a very beautiful
variety, distinguished hy its long racemes of flowcrs at the points of
the shoots, by which the latter arebent down, both when in bloasom
and when the fruit isripe, so as to give the whole trec a pendulous

appearance.

Descriplion. ln a wild state, the bird cherry formsa small trec, or l e
θ

διιεὴ, of lost. or last. in heifipt· but, in good soil, and trained to a siiigi

atem, it will attairr to double at height, or more, with a unuh upwards ot a

foot in diameter. The hranches are spreading, and covered witha purplish

’ hark,s tted with white. The leaves are fiuely serrated‚ smooth, and sorne-

what gaucous3 arrd their scent, when bruiscd, resembles that of rue. The

· flowers are of a pure white, in copious, long, drooping clusters, making an

elegant appearance rn spring, but scarcely lasting a sortnight. The fruit rs
small, blaclr, austere, and bitter, with a large corrugated nat. “ Birds of
several kinds soon devour thia fruit, which is nauseous, and rohably dan-
gcrous to nranlrind3 though, perhaps, lilre that of the cherry icurel, not of
so deadly a quality as thc essentral oil or distillcd water of the leaves.”
(Eng. Horo, ir. p. 354.) The tree grows rapidly when young, attaining the
height of 10 ft. or ran. in tor 6 years; and, as it has aloose head, and bears
pruning, it allows the grass to row rurder it.

Geogroply, ffistory, dc. Tic bird cherry is found wild in woods in most
parta of Europe, and in the north-west of Asia. lt rrows on Mount Cauca·
aaa, in Russiain Siberiaas far as lat. 62ο rv., in Lap nd aa sar as lat. twa,
and in Kamtschatlra. lt is to be found ia every art of Engiaud,and iu
man places in Scotland and Ireland. ln the north of England, according
to rnch, it grows to the height of 1600st. above the level of the sea. ln
Scotland, it is common as an undergrowth, in native woods, more particularly
in tolerably dry soils. lt was known to Theophrastus (see p. 17.) 3 and seems
to have been first noticed by Matthiolus on the Continent, and by Gerard in
Britain. Gerard says that, in his time, it grew wild in the woods of Kent,
where it was used as a stock to graft cherries on, ruore particularly the
Flanders cherry. ln Lancashire, he says, it was found in almost every hedge.

Properties aad Uter. The wood is hard and yellowish, and, in a green state,
it has a disagreeablehittcr odorw and tacte ; whence the French name patiet,
from puer. lt is much sought after in France by the cabinetmakers and
turners, who increase the heauty of itsveining by sawiug out the boardi dia·
gonally, that is, ohliqnely across the trunp, instead of parallel with its length.
