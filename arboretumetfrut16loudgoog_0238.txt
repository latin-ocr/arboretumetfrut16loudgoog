tc a hagesiae, so that in some parts ol Italy there are large woods ol than,
but we cannot hope to have them grow to ao large stema in England; for,
should these trees be pruned up, in order to form them into stems, the srost
would theu become much more hurtsul to them than in the manner they
usually grow, with their brenches close tc the ground: however, ifthene
trees are planted p'retty close together, in large thickets, and permitted tc
grow rude, they wr de end each other srcm the frost, and they will grow tc
a considerable height3 an instance of whichis now in that noble plantation os
evergreen trees made by His Gracc the ane of Bedt’ord at Wobnru Abbey,
where there is a considerable hill entirely covered with laurels; and in the
other parts ol the same plantatione there are a great number oi these inter·
mixed with thc other erergreen trees, where they are already grown to a
considerable sire, and make a noble appearance.'’ (Dici, oth edit, art. Pt-

the Loudon gardens, and which are to be found in every garden, large or
small, without exce non, vir. the holly, the common laurei, and the Portu·
gal laurel, are foun to be rather delicate in the neighbourhood oi Paris ς and
hence the suburban gardens os that city are totally destitute of broad-leared
evergreens,and have a naked and cold appearance in the winter asason, which

is particularly and strikingly unpleasant to eyes accustomed to the clothed ,

and cheerful aspect of our English gardens at that season. The sante ob-
servatione will apply to the gardent in Germany, Holland, and Belgium in

which latter country, though holly hedges have been formed in some places, 3
yet, in severe wintere, they are liable, in common with laureis and all our other ἶ
broad-leaved evergreens, to be killed down to the ground. (Iar Agrimenr de l

moat ornamental oi our evergreen shrubs ς and itis also used for coveriug
walls, and for hedges,to afford shelter; for which last purpose it ia extensivcly
used in the malecgucens about lslcworth. Evelyu mentions a fine hedge,
planted alternately with the variegated and the common laurel, and naim
so aa to have a c equetad appearance, white and green ς which, according to
the teate ol his time, was rechoned to hare a splendid effect, though the
variegation of this shrub is very irregular, not constant, and atterrded, in
general, by mutilated leaves. He also says it may be hain& so as to resem-
ble the most hmutisul hcaded orange tree in shspe and verdure, and prognos-
ticates that, intime, itmayemulete romeos our losty'timber trees, and be
