Trita order consiste of two era; and the rnoat of its characteristics
are included in the generic tera which are given below.

Ta‘rraarx Deae. Calyx intent, parted into 4-s lobes that are subimbri·
cetely aestivatad Pe st-5‚ inserted into the base of the calyx, alternate

These genere were originally included under oue genus, ‘limat-in tbe

separation being nrade on account of the above technioal distinctions. “The

plsnts of the penus numana? Royle observes, “are distributed overe wide
extentos territory in the Old World3 from 10ο to 50ο and 55ο of N. lat. in

Europe and Siberia; and from the Canaries and Senegambia οιι the west,

to China on the esst. They differ as much in their looelities ns iu their

latitndes3 bei found οιι rhethores of the ocean, or the banks of rivers (es

There are two species of Thurarix common in Indie3 viz. T. ludica an

Τ. diolco. ‘⁶ The former, found on the banks of the Ganges, end other rivers,

as well es on the coast of Corontandel, bas been referred, by some authors, to

T. gillica, with which it is closely allied ; and, if identical‚ the circumstance

will afford an additional instance of the t extent over which a species may

spread, when growin in the vicinityo water. 7¹.de Hamilt. is the T.

orlenthlis of Forat ,end ia common in the drier parts of the Βοιὼ, and at

Dethi; end also in Arubia and Egypt. Myrichrie, the other &nus of this

order, includes Temarix germfuica, which extends from Europe to the Ceu·

casus: others ecies, or perhaps verieties, are found in Siberis and Dahuria,
and two in the 'malayas' lm) Thmarix gdllica aud Myriddapnndnicn
