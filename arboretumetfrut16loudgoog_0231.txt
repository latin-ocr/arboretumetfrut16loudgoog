’l'o those who have seen the two trees known by these names in the London
gardens growing together, there can be so little doubt on the subject, that we
are tempted to conclude that the Prdnns virginiina of linuatus, and 0.

C. virginidna; by their leaves, which are rough, thick, and not shining in the
former: while in the latter they are thin, smootb, and shining. The leaves
of C. virginiana remain on till late in the autumn, and sometimes till spring,
retaining their colour till they drop off ; so that the tree may be considered as
sub-ever n; while those of C. Padus become yellow in A st, about the
time malitiis ripens, and soon afterwards drop off. Sir W. . Hoolter ss of
opinion that lilrchaux has confounded 0. virginiana with C. serotina3 but,
as we believe thern to be both the earne, thiais to usa matter of little conse-
quence. lf they 'are not distinct species, they ere, at alimenta, very distinct
taces.

Gengrnphy, History, dc. ln the Atlantic states of America, as wellas iu
those of the west, this cherry is more or less abundant, as the soil and climate
are more or less favourable to its growth ς ιο which extremes of cold and
beat in the sensons,and of dryness and humidity in the soil, are alike unfa-
vourable. lt abounds in the lllinois‚ in Genessee, and in Upper Canada; but
is nowhere more profusely multiplied‚ nor more full developad,than beyond
the mountaine in the states of Ohio, Kentucky‚ and Tennessee. ln the state
of Maiae, where tbe winter is long and intense, it hardly exceeds 30 fl. or 40ft
in height, and from Sin. to lain. in diatneter. ln the southern and maritime

in the upper parts of these states, where the climate is milder, and the soil
more fertile, it is sufficientiy common, though less multiplied there than in
Virginis and Pennsylvania. Wherever it abounds, it is found associated with
Quercus macrocr‘srpa, Jdglans nigra, Gleditschin triacinthos, U‘lmus rdbra,
and Gymndcladus cenedensis3 forming immense messes of forest, which it
adorus by its beautiful flowers in May, and which it contributes to stock with
birds, by the great nourishment which it affords to them with its fiuits in
August, September, and October. The Virginius bird cherr pen to
