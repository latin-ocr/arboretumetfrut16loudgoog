Pruning. The rose requires to be pruned every year; the oneng-growing
hardy kinds in the autumn, or the beginning of muter, end themora render
kinds early in spring. Dumont recommends pruning the early-flowering sorta
in autumn, end the late sorts during spnng; but neither during winter.
Rirers observes that pruning should always be performed in October or
Marchr but October pruning, he says, will be found decidedly the most ad·
vautageous, as, the pant having less wood and server buda to nourish during
the winter, the buds teu will have acquired extra vigour sor pushing in the
whatever. ln theo tion ot* pruning three objects oughtliiieirgskgiiniri

Some varietirs require much less pruning than others; and climbers, and
moa of the varieties ol' the Scotch rose, should, in gener& only bare their
shoots fflnned out, and should be but seldom‚ ii ever, shortened. ln
shortening you shoots, not more than liorn two to three, or, st most, forrr
buds, should be eit on each. The curs should be made close above the bud,
about the thickness os a sirpence from it, and sloping away from it at an
angle oi about 45⁰. Astandard rose,pro erly runed, will, in general, re-

Summer Praniug. By cutting ont wood at different times during summer, s
sireeession of reses may be produced, more especially in the Noisettes, and
other China venetica, and m the rose des quatre misens: but this practice
should never be adopted as a general one; because, by occasioning extraordi-

unobjectronable are, thinning out with the linger and thumb the flower buda
aa soon as they arc discernible‚ so as to leave no more than what the plant
can bring to pertentium and, aster these buda have expanded and begae to
decay‚euttin thern off close to the floral leaf. ln perierming this last operation,

which have haidsoine calyxer, and others which produce large and showy
coloured hips‚ such as the epple-bearing rose: in both these cases, instead ot*
cutting off the decayed flower, the decayed petala only should be picked out ς
and thia, also, should be done in the case el those rosea which, when the
stallis of the decayed flowers are cut off, are apt to produce summer shoots.

ln the ease ol' single reses, the cutting oii of the decayed flowers is not

state of incipient decay which gives that slovenly appearance, so conmary
